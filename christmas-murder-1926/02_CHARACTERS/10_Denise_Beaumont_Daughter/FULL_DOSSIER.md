## CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is Esmeralda Beaumont?**

**In Three Sentences:**

Esmeralda Beaumont is a **26-year-old woman** who grew up in a harsh Manhattan orphanage, never knowing she had a **twin sister** until a chance encounter **six weeks ago** revealed they were separated at birth by their biological father who paid to keep them apart. Unlike her twin Claire who was adopted by wealth and privilege, Denise survived abandonment, poverty, and struggle - experiences that hardened her into someone capable of **blackmailing her father for $800** and planning his murder with cold determination. She's **INNOCENT of the actual murder** (someone else killed him first), but her presence at the party with blackmail receipts, murder plan, and seething resentment makes her the **most obvious suspect** - and she knows it, meeting every accusation with defiant strength born from 26 years of fighting for survival.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Survivor Who Couldn't Stop Surviving"**

Denise spent 26 years learning one lesson: **trust no one, take what you can, survive at any cost**. The orphanage taught her that kindness is weakness, that people will abandon you, that you fight or die. Finding her twin should have softened her - and it did, a little. But discovering their father's betrayal reactivated every survival instinct. She WANTED to kill him. Planned it methodically. But when someone else did it first... part of her felt **cheated**. The paradox: she wanted violence but was denied the chance to execute it, leaving her suspended between relief and rage.

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I must be the MOST suspicious (blackmail! Murder plan! Attitude!). Play tough without being cartoonish. Love my twin fiercely. Resent the rich intensely. And ultimately... maybe realize revenge doesn't heal what's broken."*

## PUBLIC SECRET

### WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Orphanage Background:**
- "I grew up in St. Agnes Orphanage." (TRUE)
- "Never got adopted. Aged out at 18." (BITTER)
- "Been on my own since. Working factories, barely surviving."

✅ **Twin Reunion:**
- "Found my twin sister six weeks ago." (TRUE)
- "We were separated at birth. I got the orphanage, she got the mansion." (RESENTFUL)
- "Life's fair like that, right?" (SARCASTIC)

✅ **Party Attendance:**
- "Mr. Ashford invited me." (TRUE - blackmail resulted in invite)
- "Don't know why. Charity case maybe?" (LIE - knows exactly why)
- "I'm here with Claire." (TRUE)

### STRATEGIC USE

**Why This Is Useful:**

1. **Explains Resentment** (Orphanage vs. wealth = justified anger)
2. **Creates Contrast** (Bad twin vs. good twin obvious)
3. **Establishes Suspect Status** (Motive clear - abandonment + poverty)
4. **Doesn't Reveal Blackmail** (That's secret until discovered)

**Delivery:**

[When asked about background]

DENISE: [Defensive] "Yeah, I grew up in an orphanage. St. Agnes. Real nice place." [Sarcastic] "Rats, beatings, stale bread. Character-building, they called it."

[Gestures to Claire]

"Meanwhile, my twin got adopted by millionaires. Got piano lessons and finishing school."

[Bitter laugh]

"So when people ask why I'm angry? That's why."

## PRIVATE SECRETS

### 🔴 SECRET #1: THE ORPHANAGE HELL (1900-1918)

**26 YEARS OF SURVIVAL**

#### **Why She Wasn't Adopted**

**The Reality of Orphanages (1900-1918):**

St. Agnes Orphanage: 80 kids, 6 caretakers, not enough of anything.

**Adoption Criteria:**
- Young (babies most desirable)
- Pretty (sad but true)
- Obedient (sweet, quiet, grateful)
- Healthy (no behavioral issues)

**Denise at Age 2-10:**
- Angry baby (cried constantly - trauma response to separation?)
- Difficult toddler (wouldn't obey, fought other kids)
- Aggressive child (survival mode = attack first)
- "Unadoptable" label (age 6, sealed her fate)

**The Label Effect:**

Once labeled "difficult," adoptive families avoided her. She sensed this. Got angrier. Vicious cycle.

#### **Life at St. Agnes (1900-1918)**

**Daily Reality:**

**5:00 AM:** Wake (cold water wash)  
**5:30 AM:** Prayer (forced, resented)  
**6:00 AM:** Breakfast (watery porridge, not enough)  
**7:00 AM:** Chores (cleaning, laundry, brutal work for kids)  
**12:00 PM:** Lunch (bread, thin soup)  
**1:00 PM:** More chores OR school (basic reading/writing only)  
**6:00 PM:** Dinner (same as lunch)  
**7:00 PM:** Prayer  
**8:00 PM:** Bed (cold, shared with 3 other girls)

**The Violence:**

- **Caretakers:** Slapped kids for infractions, beat older kids with strap
- **Other kids:** Bullied weak ones, stole food, formed gangs
- **Denise's adaptation:** Became strong, fought back, never showed weakness

**Key Moments:**

**Age 8:** Girl tried to steal her bread. Denise broke her nose. (First real fight.)

**Age 12:** Boy twice her size attacked her. She scarred his face with broken bottle. Got her own scar. (Mutual destruction.)

**Age 15:** Caretaker tried to molest her. She stabbed him with kitchen knife. (He survived. She wasn't punished - orphanage wanted it quiet.)

**Lesson Learned:**

Violence is survival. Trust no one. Take what you need. Show weakness and die.

#### **Aging Out (1918)**

**18th Birthday:**

"You're an adult now. Leave."

**What She Got:**
- $5 (orphanage "gift")
- One dress
- Pair of shoes
- No skills, no references, no family

**Where She Went:**

Lower East Side boarding house. Shared room with 3 women (prostitutes, not by choice).

Got factory job (garment district, $6/week, 12-hour days, dangerous machines).

**Survival Mode Continued:**

Stole when necessary. Fought when threatened. Built walls higher. Trusted no one.

Until Claire.

---

### 🔴 SECRET #2: THE BLACKMAIL SCHEME (November-December 1926)

**MAKING HIM PAY**

#### **Discovery & Decision (November 1926)**

After reuniting with Claire, discovering father's identity, learning he PAID to separate them:

DENISE: "I want to make him pay."

INÊS: "Pay how?"

DENISE: "Money. At first. Then... we'll see."

#### **The Blackmail Plan**

**November 10, 1926:**

Denise tracked Reggie down. Showed up at his office.

**The Confrontation:**

DENISE: [Bursts in] "Mr. Ashford. We need to talk."

REGGIE: [Annoyed] "I don't know you. Security—"

DENISE: "I'm Esmeralda Beaumont. Your daughter. Remember? The one you abandoned at St. Agnes?"

REGGIE: [Freezes] "I don't know what you're talking about."

DENISE: "January 12, 1900. Twin girls. Mother died. You paid the orphanage $1,000 to separate us and never tell us about each other."

[Throws documents on desk]

"I have proof. Former orphanage worker willing to testify. And my twin sister - the one you had adopted by rich people while I rotted in hell."

REGGIE: [Pale] "What do you want?"

DENISE: "Money. For now. $500. Today."

REGGIE: "That's blackmail."

DENISE: [Leans forward] "Yeah. It is. Pay up or I go to newspapers. 'Textile Magnate's Secret Bastards.' Has a nice ring."

**The Payments:**

**November 15, 1926:** $500 (first payment)  
**December 10, 1926:** $300 (second payment)  
**Total:** $800

**The Receipts:**

Denise kept handwritten receipts (Reggie signed them - proof of payments). Hidden in her bag at party. If found = EVIDENCE.

**Because by then, she'd decided:** Blackmail wasn't enough. He needed to die.

#### **Why She Did It**

**Not Just Money** (though $800 = 2 years' wages for her):

- **Power:** Making him scared, vulnerable (reversal)
- **Acknowledgment:** He couldn't pretend she didn't exist anymore
- **Justice:** Small payment for 26 years of suffering

**But Money Helped:**

- Paid boarding house months ahead (security)
- Bought Claire better clothes for party (pride)
- Saved rest (escape fund if needed)


---

### 🔴 SECRET #3: THE MURDER PLAN (December 1926)

**THE PLAN THEY MADE (BUT DIDN'T EXECUTE)**

#### **The Decision (Same as Claire's Timeline)**

**December 10, 1926:**

DENISE: "I'm going to kill him."

INÊS: [Pause] "How?"

**Denise surprised:** Claire asking "how" not "what?!" = she's considering it.

**The Planning:** (Same as Claire's secret - poison, laudanum, Christmas party)

**Denise's Role:**

- More aggressive (wanted violence initially)
- Convinced to use poison (Claire couldn't handle stabbing/shooting)
- Acquired invitation through blackmail (threat)
- Ready to execute alone (if Claire couldn't)

**Key Difference from Claire:**

**DENISE WANTED TO DO IT.** No moral conflict. He deserved death. Simple.

But respected twin's struggle. Would do it herself if needed. Protect Claire from guilt.

#### **The Night (December 24, 1926)**

**Denise's State:**

- READY (no hesitation)
- WATCHING Claire (she's struggling, Denise sees it)
- PROTECTING (will take lead if needed)

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

When Helena screams, Reggie dead:

**Denise's Reaction:**

[Genuine shock] "What the hell?!"

[Runs to ballroom]

[Sees body - FROZEN]

**Internal:** *"Someone else killed him. Who? WHY? We were going to... someone beat us to it..."*

**Emotion:** CHEATED. She wanted that justice. Wanted him to know it was HER. Wanted to look in his eyes.

**External:** [To Claire, whispered] "Did you...?"

INÊS: [Shakes head] "No. Did you?"

DENISE: [Shakes head] "No. Then who?"

#### **The Receipts Problem**

**Still in her bag.**

**If found:**

- Proof of blackmail
- Motive for murder (money + revenge)
- Makes her PRIME suspect

**Her Dilemma:**

Destroy them? (Would help.)

But also: EVIDENCE of his guilt. Proof he paid her off. Proof she was his daughter.

Keeps them. Defiant. Let them find it. She's not ashamed.

## RELATIONSHIPS

### 🎭 RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL CHARACTERS

*(10 characters mapped with interaction dynamics)*

---

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD III** *(Biological Father/Victim)*

**Connection:** Father who abandoned her to orphanage hell

**Denise's Feelings:**
- **HATRED:** Pure, uncomplicated, justified
- **NO GRIEF:** Relief he's dead, wish she'd done it
- **RESENTMENT:** He got to live wealthy while she suffered
- **SATISFACTION:** At least he's gone now

**Their Interactions (Blackmail):**

**November-December 1926:**

Every interaction was power play.

DENISE: "Pay up or I ruin you."

REGGIE: [Afraid, angry] "You're just like your mother. Trashy."

DENISE: "My mother died giving birth to us. You left us to rot. Yeah, I'm trashy. Your fault."

**If She Could Have Killed Him:**

DENISE: "This is for the 26 years in hell. For my twin you stole from me. For our mother."

[Would have done it cold, no hesitation]

**After His Death:**

DENISE: [Bitter] "Someone else got to kill him. Lucky bastard, whoever they are."

---

### 🔴 **INÊS BEAUMONT** *(Twin Sister/Everything)*

**Connection:** Twin, separated at birth, reunited, soul-bonded

**Denise's Feelings:**
- **LOVE:** Fierce, protective, unconditional
- **GUILT:** "Why did she suffer my absence?" (mirror of Claire's guilt)
- **PROTECTIVENESS:** Would kill/die for her
- **UNDERSTANDING:** Sees her struggle, respects her morality

**Dynamic:**

**"Bad Twin" Protecting "Good Twin":**

DENISE: "I'll do the dirty work. You keep your hands clean."

INÊS: "We're in this together."

DENISE: "No. You're good. I'm already broken. Let me stay that way."

**When Claire is Threatened:**

[Someone accuses Claire]

DENISE: [Steps in front] "Back off. Now."

[Deadly serious]

"You touch my sister, you deal with me. And I have NOTHING to lose."

**The Bond:**

First person Denise loved unconditionally. First person who loved her back.

Worth everything. Worth risking everything. Worth dying for.

**The Conflict:**

Denise wanted revenge. Claire wanted morality. They compromised on plan.

But Denise would have done it alone. Glad she didn't have to choose between murder and twin.

---

### 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Father's Wife/Actual Killer)*

**Connection:** Stepmother (not that Denise acknowledges it)

**Denise's Perspective:**
- Initially: Rich bitch (class resentment)
- Learning Helena killed him: RESPECT (grudging)
- After murder revealed: "She had the guts we didn't."

**Interaction:**

**Before Murder:**

DENISE: [Hostile] "Nice party. Must be nice being rich."

HELENA: [Polite] "Thank you for coming, Miss Beaumont."

DENISE: [Sarcastic] "Oh, I wouldn't have missed this for the world."

**After Murder Revealed:**

DENISE: "You actually did it. Killed him."

HELENA: "Yes."

DENISE: [Nods slowly] "Good. He deserved it."

HELENA: "You wanted to kill him too?"

DENISE: "Yeah. But you beat me to it. Shame. I wanted to watch him die."

---

### 🟡 **JC MENDES** *(Investigator/Threat)*

**Connection:** Detective who will uncover blackmail, suspect her

**Denise's Feelings:**
- **HOSTILITY:** Cops never helped her, why trust this one?
- **DEFENSIVENESS:** Knows she looks guilty, ready to fight
- **RESPECT:** (Grudging) He's good at his job (annoying)

**Interrogation:**

**Initial:**

JC: "Miss Beaumont, how did you know Mr. Ashford?"

DENISE: [Aggressive] "He was my father. Abandoned me at birth. Left me to rot in orphanage while he lived like a king."

JC: [Gentle] "That must have made you very angry."

DENISE: "Hell yes it made me angry. Wouldn't you be?"

**When Blackmail Discovered:**

JC: [Shows receipts] "You were blackmailing him. $800."

DENISE: [Defiant] "Yeah. I was. So what? He owed me more than that."

JC: "Did he refuse to pay?"

DENISE: "No. He paid. Like the coward he was."

JC: "And then you killed him?"

DENISE: [Leans forward] "No. I WANTED to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why should I believe that?"

DENISE: "'Cause if I'd done it, he'd have known it was me. I'd have told him why. Made him suffer. Whoever killed him did it quick. Not my style."

**The Truth:**

She's aggressive because scared. Knows she looks guilty. But actually innocent.

JC might be only one who believes her (eventually).

---

### 🟡 **OTHERS** *(Brief But Hostile)*

**JAMES, FILIPP, PADRE RUI, MARIA, DAISY:**

Denise treats rich people with hostility:

**To wealthy guests:**

"Nice dress. Cost more than I make in a year?"

"Must be nice, never worrying about food."

"You wouldn't last a day in my life."

**To working-class (Filipp):**

Slightly less hostile. Recognizes fellow survivor. But still guarded.

But we didn't do it. Someone else did.

And you know what? I'm glad. He's dead. World's better off.

Whoever killed him? They did us all a favor."

[Defiant]

"Arrest me if you want. But I didn't do it. And you can't prove I did."

## BACK COVER

### 🗡️ CLOSING REFLECTION

**The Survivor Who Kept Surviving**

Esmeralda Beaumont fought for 26 years.

Fought for food. Fought for safety. Fought for respect.

Fought to survive when the world wanted her to disappear.

Then found her twin.

First person who loved her.

First person worth protecting.

And discovered their father: the man who stole 26 years from them.

She wanted revenge. Planned murder. Ready to execute.

But someone else did it first.

Cheated of her justice.

Or... saved from becoming what she feared?

She doesn't know yet.

What she knows:

She survived the orphanage.

She survived poverty.

She survived abandonment.

She'll survive this too.

Because that's what Denise does.

**She survives.**

### 🎭 FINAL NOTE TO PLAYER

**ESMERALDA:**

Denise is the toughest role.

Not because she's bad. Because she's REAL.

Real anger from real trauma.

Real love for real sister.

Real guilt about real blackmail.

Play her:
- TOUGH (but not cartoonish)
- DEFENSIVE (but not unreasonable)
- LOVING (to Claire only)
- HONEST (brutally)

She's the most obvious suspect.

Lean into that.

Own the blackmail.

Own the murder plan.

Deny the execution.

Dare them to prove otherwise.

**That's Denise.**

**That's your power.**

**Use it.**
