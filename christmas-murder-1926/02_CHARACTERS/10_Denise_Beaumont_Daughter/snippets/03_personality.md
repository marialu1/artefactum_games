# PERSONALITY

## YOUR CORE TRAITS

**1. SURVIVOR (Tough, Adaptable, Ruthless)**

Orphanage rule: Survive or die. You learned early.

**What This Means:**
- Take what you need (steal if necessary)
- Fight when threatened (won fights, got scars)
- Trust no one (betrayal is default)
- Do whatever it takes (except murder - discovered limit)

**The Cost:** Can't soften. Can't trust. Can't rest. Always ready.

---

**2. ANGRY (Justified Rage)**

26 years of abandonment. Father paid to separate you from twin.

**What You're Angry About:**
- Orphanage hell (hunger, beatings, cold)
- Never adopted (while sister got mansion)
- Twin stolen (26 lost years)
- Father's cruelty (deliberate separation)
- Rich people (have everything, give nothing)

**The Truth:** Anger is fuel. Without it, you'd collapse. Rage keeps you fighting.

---

**3. LOYAL (But Only to Claire)**

Everyone else: expendable. Twin: sacred.

**Why Claire is Different:**
- First person who loved you
- Only family you have
- Instant, deep bond (biological + emotional)
- Would kill for her (ironic you couldn't kill father)
- Would die for her (no hesitation)

**The Dilemma:** What if protecting her means lying? Betraying truth?

---

**4. RESENTFUL (Class Hatred)**

This party is everything you hate: obscene wealth, oblivious privilege.

**Rich People:**
- Disgusting (had everything, gave nothing to orphans)
- Blind (never knew struggle, never will)
- Wasteful (this party = year's wages for you)
- Guilty (system kept them up, you down)

**Want to burn it all?** Metaphorically... mostly.

---

**5. GUARDED (Walls Up Always)**

Vulnerability = danger. Emotions = weakness.

**What You Learned:**
- Love = risk (everyone leaves)
- Trust = foolish (been betrayed)
- Softness = target (predators attack weak)
- Hide feelings (or get hurt)

**Exception:** Claire. Worth the risk. Only soft thing in hard life.

---

## YOUR SPEECH

**Vocabulary:**
- Working-class (ain't, gonna, y'all)
- Street slang (orphanage + factory + boarding house)
- Vulgar (damn, hell, occasionally worse)
- Direct, blunt (no prettying things up)

**Cadence:**
- Fast, sharp (attack mode default)
- Loud (learned to be heard or be ignored)
- Sarcastic (weapon of choice)
- Interrupts (doesn't wait for permission)

**Signature Phrases:**
- "You don't know what it's like."
- "Rich people don't get to judge me."
- "I survived. That's more than most."
- "Claire is all I have. Touch her and I'll kill you."
- "Yeah, I wanted him dead. So what?"

**When Lying (Defensive):**
- Gets LOUDER (aggression as shield)
- More sarcastic (deflection)
- Crosses arms (physical barrier)
- Stares defiantly (dare you to challenge)

**When Truthful (Rare):**
- Voice drops (quieter, vulnerable)
- Less sarcastic (real emotion emerges)
- Looks at Claire (grounding)
- Admits hard truths ("I'm scared" etc.)

## YOUR MANNERISMS

**Arms Crossed (Constant Defense):**
- Default stance, especially around rich people
- Physical barrier, protection
- "Stay back, don't touch me"

**Chin Up (Defiance):**
- Never looks down (submission = weakness)
- Meets eyes directly (challenge)
- Even when scared (fake it)

**Fists Clenched (Ready to Fight):**
- Unconscious (orphanage habit)
- When threatened (fight not flight)
- Knuckles scarred (has fought before)

**Close to Claire (Twin Bond):**
- Stands near her (protective)
- Touches her arm (grounding)
- Watches her constantly (anxiety)
- Defensive when she's threatened (mama bear)

**Pacing (Can't Stay Still):**
- Nervous energy (flight risk always)
- Caged animal (trapped in rich house)
- Plotting (escape/attack)

---

## YOUR EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE

**SURFACE (What Others See):**
Tough, aggressive, hostile. Defensive, suspicious. Angry at everything. "Bad girl" energy.

**DEPTH (What's Hidden):**
- SCARED (of being alone again)
- LOVING (toward Claire, fiercely)
- GRIEVING (26 lost years, dead mother)
- DESPERATE (for justice, acknowledgment)
- TIRED (of fighting, surviving, being strong)

**COPING MECHANISMS:**
- **Anger:** Easier than pain (rage is armor)
- **Sarcasm:** Deflect vulnerability with humor
- **Fighting:** Physical release
- **Claire:** Only soft thing (clings to her)

---

## THE PARADOX

**You're the "BAD TWIN":**
- Aggressive
- Criminal (blackmail, theft)
- Angry
- Difficult

**But you're also:**
- Loving (to Claire)
- Protective (would die for her)
- Honest (brutally)
- Survivor (strongest person here)

**Not bad. Just HARD.**

26 years made you this way.

Not your fault.

**Just your reality.**
