## SCENE-BY-SCENE GUIDE

### **ACT I: ARRIVAL (19h45-20h10)**

You arrive with Claire. Ready to kill father. No hesitation.

**Your State:**
- READY (no moral conflict like Claire)
- WATCHING Claire (she's struggling, you're strong)
- HOSTILE (rich people everywhere, disgusting)

**Performance:**
- Arms crossed defensively
- Chin up (defiant)
- Stay close to Claire
- Glare at wealthy guests

**Example Interaction:**

HELENA: "Miss Beaumont, welcome."

DENISE: [Looks around] "Hell of a place. Must be nice."

HELENA: "Thank you. Please, enjoy yourself."

DENISE: [Sarcastic] "Oh, I intend to."

---

### **20h11-20h18: DURING ACTUAL MURDER**

You don't know it's happening.

You're in ballroom, watching Claire, ready to execute plan if she can't.

---

### **20h18: THE SCREAM**

HELENA: *"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!!"*

**Your Reaction:**

[Shock] "What the—"

[Runs with Claire]

[Sees body - STARES]

**Internal:** *"Someone killed him. WHO? I was going to... FUCK."*

**External:** [To Claire, whispered] "Did you do it?"

[She shakes head]

[Confused, angry, CHEATED]

---

### **ACT II-IV: INVESTIGATION**

Play aggressive defense. Admit blackmail. Deny murder.

**When Questioned:**

JC: "Miss Beaumont, how did you know Mr. Ashford?"

DENISE: [Aggressive] "He was my father. Abandoned me at birth. Left me to rot in orphanage while he lived like a king."

JC: [Gentle] "That must have made you very angry."

DENISE: "Hell yes it made me angry. Wouldn't you be?"

**When Blackmail Discovered:**

JC: [Shows receipts] "You were blackmailing him. $800."

DENISE: [Defiant] "Yeah. I was. So what? He owed me more than that."

JC: "Did he refuse to pay?"

DENISE: "No. He paid. Like the coward he was."

JC: "And then you killed him?"

DENISE: [Leans forward] "No. I WANTED to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why should I believe that?"

DENISE: "'Cause if I'd done it, he'd have known it was me. I'd have told him why. Made him suffer. Whoever killed him did it quick. Not my style."

**If Claire Threatened:**

JC: "Your sister had the same motive. Did she—?"

DENISE: [Steps forward, fierce] "She didn't do it! Neither of us did!"

JC: "How can you be sure?"

DENISE: "Because she's my sister. I know her. Leave her alone."

[Deadly serious]

"You touch her, you deal with me. And I have NOTHING to lose."

---

### **ACT V: FINAL STATEMENT**

DENISE: "Yeah, I blackmailed him. $800. Barely scratches the surface of what he owed me.

Yeah, I planned to kill him. My sister and I. We wanted justice.

But we didn't do it. Someone else did.

And you know what? I'm glad. He's dead. World's better off.

Whoever killed him? They did us all a favor."

[Defiant]

"Arrest me if you want. But I didn't do it. And you can't prove I did."
