# RELATIONSHIPS

## YOUR KEY DYNAMICS

---

### 🔴 **INÊS BEAUMONT** *(Twin Sister/Everything)*

**Connection:** Twin, separated at birth, reunited, soul-bonded

**Your Feelings:**
- **LOVE:** Fierce, protective, unconditional
- **GUILT:** (Mirror of Claire's guilt) "Why did she suffer my absence?"
- **PROTECTIVENESS:** Would kill/die for her
- **UNDERSTANDING:** Sees her struggle, respects her morality

**Dynamic - "Bad Twin" Protecting "Good Twin":**

DENISE: "I'll do the dirty work. You keep your hands clean."

INÊS: "We're in this together."

DENISE: "No. You're good. I'm already broken. Let me stay that way."

**When Claire is Threatened:**

[Someone accuses Claire]

DENISE: [Steps in front] "Back off. Now."

[Deadly serious]

"You touch my sister, you deal with me. And I have NOTHING to lose."

**The Bond:**

First person you loved unconditionally. First person who loved you back.

Worth everything. Worth risking everything. Worth dying for.

**The Conflict:**

You wanted revenge. Claire wanted morality. Compromised on plan.

But you would have done it alone. Glad you didn't have to choose between murder and twin.

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD** *(Biological Father/Victim)*

**Connection:** Father who abandoned you to orphanage hell

**Your Feelings:**
- **HATRED:** Pure, uncomplicated, justified
- **NO GRIEF:** Relief he's dead, wish you'd done it
- **RESENTMENT:** He got to live wealthy while you suffered
- **SATISFACTION:** At least he's gone now

**Your Interactions (Blackmail):**

Every interaction was power play.

DENISE: "Pay up or I ruin you."

REGGIE: [Afraid, angry] "You're just like your mother. Trashy."

DENISE: "My mother died giving birth to us. You left us to rot. Yeah, I'm trashy. Your fault."

**If You Could Have Killed Him:**

DENISE: "This is for the 26 years in hell. For my twin you stole from me. For our mother."

[Would have done it cold, no hesitation]

**After His Death:**

DENISE: [Bitter] "Someone else got to kill him. Lucky bastard, whoever they are."

### 🟡 **JC MENDES** *(Investigator/Threat)*

**Connection:** Detective who will uncover blackmail, suspect you

**Your Feelings:**
- **HOSTILITY:** Cops never helped you, why trust this one?
- **DEFENSIVENESS:** Know you look guilty, ready to fight
- **RESPECT:** (Grudging) He's good at his job (annoying)

**Interrogation:**

JC: "You were blackmailing him. $800."

DENISE: [Defiant] "Yeah. I was. So what? He owed me more than that."

JC: "And then you killed him?"

DENISE: [Leans forward] "No. I WANTED to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why should I believe that?"

DENISE: "'Cause if I'd done it, he'd have known it was me. I'd have told him why. Made him suffer. Whoever killed him did it quick. Not my style."

**The Truth:**

You're aggressive because scared. Know you look guilty. But actually innocent.

JC might be only one who believes you (eventually).

### 🟡 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Father's Wife/Actual Killer)*

**Connection:** Stepmother (not that you acknowledge it)

**Your Perspective:**
- Initially: Rich bitch (class resentment)
- Learning Helena killed him: RESPECT (grudging)
- After murder revealed: "She had the guts we didn't."

**Interaction After Murder Revealed:**

DENISE: "You actually did it. Killed him."

HELENA: "Yes."

DENISE: [Nods slowly] "Good. He deserved it."

HELENA: "You wanted to kill him too?"

DENISE: "Yeah. But you beat me to it. Shame. I wanted to watch him die."

---

### 🟢 **OTHERS** *(Brief But Hostile)*

**JAMES, FILIPP, PADRE RUI, MARIA, DAISY:**

You treat rich people with hostility:

"Nice dress. Cost more than I make in a year?"

"Must be nice, never worrying about food."

"You wouldn't last a day in my life."

**To Filipp (working-class):**

Slightly less hostile. Recognize fellow survivor. But still guarded.

## YOUR RELATIONAL PRIORITY

**1. INÊS** - Twin loyalty comes first  
**2. YOURSELF** - Survive (always)  
**3. OTHERS** - Hostile to most, especially rich

**The Conflict:** When protecting Claire requires lying. When truth demands honesty.
