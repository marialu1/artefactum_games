# YOUR PUBLIC SECRET

## WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Orphanage Background:**
- "I grew up in St. Agnes Orphanage." (TRUE)
- "Never got adopted. Aged out at 18." (BITTER)
- "Been on my own since. Working factories, barely surviving."

✅ **Twin Reunion:**
- "Found my twin sister six weeks ago." (TRUE)
- "We were separated at birth. I got the orphanage, she got the mansion." (RESENTFUL)
- "Life's fair like that, right?" (SARCASTIC)

✅ **Party Attendance:**
- "Mr. Ashford invited me." (TRUE - blackmail resulted in invite)
- "Don't know why. Charity case maybe?" (LIE - knows exactly why)
- "I'm here with Claire." (TRUE)

## WHY THIS IS USEFUL

**Strategic Value:**

1. **Explains Resentment** (Orphanage vs. wealth = justified anger)
2. **Creates Contrast** (Bad twin vs. good twin obvious)
3. **Establishes Suspect Status** (Motive clear - abandonment + poverty)
4. **Doesn't Reveal Blackmail** (That's secret until discovered)

## HOW TO DELIVER

**When Asked About Background:**

DENISE: [Defensive] "Yeah, I grew up in an orphanage. St. Agnes. Real nice place." [Sarcastic] "Rats, beatings, stale bread. Character-building, they called it."

[Gestures to Claire]

"Meanwhile, my twin got adopted by millionaires. Got piano lessons and finishing school."

[Bitter laugh]

"So when people ask why I'm angry? That's why."

## WHAT TO KEEP HIDDEN (For Now)

❌ Blackmail scheme ($800)  
❌ Blackmail receipts in bag  
❌ Murder plan with Claire  
❌ Father's identity (initially)  
❌ Rage at father

**These come out during interrogation when pressed or evidence found.**
