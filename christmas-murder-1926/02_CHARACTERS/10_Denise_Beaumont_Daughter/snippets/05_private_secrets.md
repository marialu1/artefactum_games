# YOUR PRIVATE SECRETS

## 🔴 SECRET #1: THE ORPHANAGE HELL (1900-1918)

**26 YEARS OF SURVIVAL**

**Why You Weren't Adopted:**
- Angry baby (cried constantly - trauma response?)
- Difficult toddler (wouldn't obey, fought other kids)
- Aggressive child (survival mode = attack first)
- "Unadoptable" label by age 6 (sealed your fate)

**Life at St. Agnes:**

**Daily Reality:**
- 5:00 AM wake (cold water wash)
- Watery porridge (not enough)
- Brutal chores (cleaning, laundry)
- Beatings (caretakers used straps)
- Bullying (other kids stole food, formed gangs)
- 8:00 PM bed (cold, shared with 3 girls)

**The Violence You Survived:**
- **Age 8:** Broke girl's nose for stealing your bread (first real fight)
- **Age 12:** Boy attacked you, you scarred his face with bottle (got your scar)
- **Age 15:** Caretaker tried to molest you, you stabbed him with knife (he survived, orphanage kept it quiet)

**Lesson Learned:**
Violence is survival. Trust no one. Take what you need. Show weakness and die.

## 🔴 SECRET #2: THE BLACKMAIL SCHEME (November-December 1926)

**MAKING HIM PAY**

**November 10, 1926:**

You tracked Reggie down. Showed up at his office.

DENISE: "Mr. Ashford. We need to talk."

REGGIE: "I don't know you. Security—"

DENISE: "I'm Esmeralda Beaumont. Your daughter. Remember? The one you abandoned at St. Agnes?"

[Throws documents on desk]

"I have proof. Former orphanage worker willing to testify. And my twin sister - the one you had adopted by rich people while I rotted in hell."

REGGIE: "What do you want?"

DENISE: "Money. For now. $500. Today."

REGGIE: "That's blackmail."

DENISE: [Leans forward] "Yeah. It is. Pay up or I go to newspapers. 'Textile Magnate's Secret Bastards.' Has a nice ring."

**The Payments:**
- **November 15, 1926:** $500 (first payment)
- **December 10, 1926:** $300 (second payment)
- **Total:** $800

**The Receipts:**

You kept handwritten receipts (Reggie signed them). **HIDDEN IN YOUR BAG AT PARTY.** If found = EVIDENCE.

**Because by then, you'd decided:** Blackmail wasn't enough. He needed to die.

## 🔴 SECRET #3: THE MURDER PLAN (December 1926)

**THE PLAN YOU MADE WITH INÊS**

**December 10, 1926:**

DENISE: "I'm going to kill him."

INÊS: [Pause] "How?"

**Your Surprise:** She's considering it, not rejecting it.

**The Method:** Poison (laudanum - Claire acquired it)

**Your Role:**
- More aggressive (wanted violence initially)
- Convinced to use poison (Claire couldn't handle stabbing/shooting)
- Acquired invitation through blackmail
- **Ready to execute alone** (if Claire couldn't)

**Key Difference from Claire:**

**YOU WANTED TO DO IT.** No moral conflict. He deserved death. Simple.

**The Night (December 24, 1926):**

**Your State:**
- READY (no hesitation)
- WATCHING Claire (she's struggling, you see it)
- PROTECTING (will take lead if needed)

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

When Helena screams, Reggie dead:

**Your Reaction:**

[Genuine shock] "What the hell?!"

[Runs to ballroom]

[Sees body - FROZEN]

**Internal:** *"Someone else killed him. Who? WHY? We were going to... someone beat us to it..."*

**Emotion:** CHEATED. You wanted that justice. Wanted him to know it was YOU.

**External:** [To Claire, whispered] "Did you...?"

INÊS: [Shakes head] "No. Did you?"

DENISE: [Shakes head] "No. Then who?"

## 🔴 SECRET #4: THE RECEIPTS PROBLEM

**Still in your bag.**

**If found:**
- Proof of blackmail
- Motive for murder ($800 + revenge)
- Makes you PRIME suspect

**Your Dilemma:**

Destroy them? (Would help.)

But also: EVIDENCE of his guilt. Proof he paid you off. Proof you were his daughter.

**You keep them.**

Defiant. Let them find it. You're not ashamed.

## IF INTERROGATED

**When Blackmail Discovered:**

JC: [Shows receipts] "You were blackmailing him. $800."

DENISE: [Defiant] "Yeah. I was. So what? He owed me more than that."

JC: "Did he refuse to pay?"

DENISE: "No. He paid. Like the coward he was."

JC: "And then you killed him?"

DENISE: [Leans forward] "No. I WANTED to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why should I believe that?"

DENISE: "'Cause if I'd done it, he'd have known it was me. I'd have told him why. Made him suffer. Whoever killed him did it quick. Not my style."

## THE TRUTH

**You did NOT kill him.**

**But you PLANNED to.**

**And honestly?**

Part of you is **GLAD** someone else did.

Part of you is **FURIOUS** you didn't get to.

**Conflicted.**

**But innocent.**
