# YOUR GOALS & STATUS

## 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

### **PRIMARY GOAL: Protect Claire**

Twin comes first. Always.

**What This Means:**
- Take blame if necessary
- Fight anyone who threatens her
- Be the strong one (she's fragile)
- Love her fiercely

---

### **SECONDARY GOAL: Survive Suspicion**

You LOOK guilty. You KNOW it. You're READY to fight.

**Strategy:**
- Aggressive defense (best offense)
- Admit blackmail (own it, no shame)
- Deny murder (truth)
- Dare them to prove it

---

### **TERTIARY GOAL: Revenge (Incomplete)**

Someone else killed him. You're CHEATED but GLAD.

**Conflicted:**
- Wanted him dead (got that)
- Wanted to do it yourself (didn't get that)
- Satisfied? (Maybe. Don't know yet.)

---

## ✅ YOUR STATUS: INNOCENT

**You Did NOT Murder Reginald Ashford.**

**But:**
- You BLACKMAILED him ($800)
- You PLANNED to murder him
- You WANTED to murder him
- You HAVE motive, means, opportunity
- You LOOK guilty as hell

**The Truth:**

Someone else did it first. You're innocent of execution. But not of intent.

And honestly? You're okay with that.

## ⚖️ THE BALANCE YOU MUST STRIKE

**Be MOST Suspicious:** Justify being prime suspect (blackmail! Attitude!)

**Stay Tough:** Not cartoonish villain, real survivor

**Protect Claire:** Twin loyalty paramount

**Own Your Anger:** No apologies, no shame

**ACT III:** Aggressive, defensive (bring it on)
