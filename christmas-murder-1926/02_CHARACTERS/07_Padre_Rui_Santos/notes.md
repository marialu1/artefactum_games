- **Profession:** Catholic priest
  - Ordained 1901 (25 years service)
  - St. Patrick's Parish, Manhattan
  - Confessor respected in Portuguese community

### Connection to Host
Invited to bless the Christmas dinner (Catholic tradition). Reggie Ashford donated $500 to the parish in November 1926 (was this a bribe for silence about Sofia Mendes?).

---

## RELATIONSHIPS

### REGINALD ASHFORD (Victim/Predator)
**Relação:** VISCERAL HATRED (but priest shouldn't hate). Corrupted Sofia Mendes.

**História:**
- **June 1926:** Reggie seduced Sofia Mendes (18, parishioner)
  - Promises of marriage: "I'll leave Helena for you"
  - Sofia = like DAUGHTER to Padre (watched her grow up - catechism, communion)
- **July 1926:** Sofia confessed to Padre (crying)
  - "Father, we love each other... he promised to marry me..."
  - Padre IMMEDIATELY understood: PREDATION (48 vs 18 years old)
  - **BUT: Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE** (cannot reveal ANYTHING)
- **What he did:** Counseled her WITHIN confessional
  - "Daughter, promises from married man are lies. Always. Distance yourself."
  - **SHE DIDN'T LISTEN** - continued seeing Reggie
- **August 1926:** Reggie terminated with Sofia (as he does with all)
  - Sofia appeared in confessional DESTROYED: "You were right... he lied..."
- **September 1926:** Reggie donated $500 to parish
  - Personally visited: "For renovations, Father. And... I appreciate your discretion."
  - **BRIBE?** Accept money (parish needs) but guilt devastates him
  - Did he sell silence for $500? Or silence already mandatory (confession)?

**TORMENT:** Hates Reggie viscerally (sexual predator) but couldn't do ANYTHING (confession seal).

### EMILIA HARRODS (Ex-Nun "Sister Cristina"/Spiritual Enemy)
**Relação:** DEEP PERSONAL RIVALRY. War: faith vs spiritualism. Mutual hidden pain.

**História:**
- **1910-1918:** She was **SISTER CRISTINA** (Convent Santa Clara, Newark)
  - Perpetual vows (poverty, chastity, obedience)
  - Dedicated to God
  - Father Juan Carlos knew her (young priest, same diocese)
- **1918: THE FALL**
  - Sister Cristina met JAMES HARRODS (donation to convent)
  - FELL IN LOVE
  - Came to Father Juan Carlos (tormented):
    - "Father Rui... I feel something... for a man..."
  - **HE TRIED TO SAVE HER:**
    - "Cristina, these are PERPETUAL VOWS! You married God!"
    - "What you feel is temptation! Pray! Fast! RESIST!"
  - **SHE:**
    - "I tried, Father. Months. I can't."
    - "He makes me feel alive. God is silence."
    - "I'm leaving."
  - **PADRE RUI (desperate):**
    - "If you leave, you BETRAY God!"
    - "Eternal damnation! For a MAN?!"
  - **SHE:**
    - "I prefer damnation with love... than salvation in solitude."
  - **SHE LEFT. Married James 6 months later.**

**NOW:**
- She = spiritualist (pretends to speak with dead - BLASPHEMY to him)
- **RIVALRY isn't just "charlatan vs religious"**
- It's **"fallen sister vs. brother who stayed"**
  - HE: everything she abandoned (faith, sacrifice, obedience)
  - SHE: his secret fear (What if God IS silence? What if human love > divine love?)

**TENSE ENCOUNTERS:**
When he sees Emilia: Pain (lost spiritual sister) + Anger (betrayal of God) + Fear (what if she was right?)

### JAMES HARRODS (Secret Penitent/Killer)
**Relação:** Heard his murder confession. KNOWS it was him. Cannot say. Watches with agony.

**História:**
- **20 December 1926, 5:30 PM - St. Patrick's Confessional**
  - Someone enters (male voice, doesn't identify yet)
  - "Forgive me Father... I will commit terrible sin."
  - "I will take a life. Human."
  - "I need to know... will God forgive?"
- **PADRE RUI (HORRIFIED):**
  - "That is MURDER! MORTAL SIN!"
  - "DON'T do it! Whatever reason, there is ANOTHER way!"
- **VOICE:**
  - "There isn't. Either he dies or I lose everything."
  - "Freedom. Love. Future."
  - "Already decided. I came because... I need forgiveness. After."
- **PADRE:**
  - "I don't give pre-meditated absolution!"
  - "FUTURE sin cannot be forgiven BEFORE!"
  - "You have free will! CHOOSE well!"
- **VOICE:**
  - "Thank you for listening, Father."
  - [LEAVES]

**IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA:**
- 🔴 Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE (breaking = automatic excommunication + damnation)
- 🔵 BUT murder will happen (someone will die)
- **OPTIONS (all impossible):**
  1. Reveal confession → Break vow, excommunication, damnation
  2. Total silence → Innocent dies, moral complicity
  3. Vague warning → "Beware Dec 24" → But to whom? How without revealing source?
- **HE CHOSE:** Silence + prayer (4 straight days: "God, stop him")
- **BUT GOD DIDN'T STOP HIM**

**DURING GAME:**
- When he hears James speak → **RECOGNIZES THE VOICE**
- Breathing, timbre, pauses (trained 25 years listening confessions)
- **CERTAINTY: It was JAMES who confessed**
- Looks at James constantly with agony during game
- James notices: "Father... do we know each other?"
- PADRE: "Only... by sight." [PIOUS LIE]

**TORMENT:** Knows who killed. CANNOT say. Human justice vs. Divine law.

### JOÃO CARLOS MENDES (Moral Ally)
**Relação:** Law vs Faith = mutual respect. Both seek justice (different methods).

**História:**
- Professional respect
- Conversations about justice, morality, truth
- Can they collaborate during investigation?

### HELENA ASHFORD (Wounded Sheep?)
**Relação:** Sees suffering in her. Pastoral compassion.

**História:**
- Notices she suffers (abusive marriage visible)
- Offers private counsel: "Daughter, if you need to talk..."
- Compassion without judgment

### DAISY VALMONT (Public Sinner)
**Relação:** Disapproves cabaret life. BUT Christian compassion.

**História:**
- "Worldly life, yes... Condemn? No."
- "'Let him without sin cast first stone.'"
- Balances dogma with humanity

### INES BEAUMONT (Innocent Lamb)
**Relação:** Sees purity/pain. Protective.

**História:**
- If she confesses (laudanum vial): gives absolution
- "Intention ≠ action. God sees heart. You resisted."
- Rewards honesty with extra clue

### DENISE BEAUMONT (Lost Sheep)
**Relação:** Blackmailer, cynic. BUT also victim. Redemption possible?

**História:**
- "Blackmail is crime, yes."
- "BUT father rejected her. Orphan. Alone. Desperate."
- "Justice without compassion is cruelty."

### Others
- **Filipp Moretti:** Padre of his parish (Little Italy). Knows his sins but respects him.
- **Maria Fletcher:** Observes his moral struggles with interest.
- **Father Juan Carlos:** Internal conflict - Dogma vs Compassion.

---

## GOALS TONIGHT

### Your Objectives This Night:

1. **DON'T BREAK CONFESSION**
   - Cost = own soul, excommunication, damnation

2. **BUT JUSTICE MUST PREVAIL**
   - How without revealing?

3. **CONFRONT EMILIA**
   - Séance = opportunity (blasphemy vs faith)

4. **GUIDE SOULS**
   - Pastoral role even in chaos

5. **PERSONAL ATONEMENT**
   - Failed Sofia - can you save others?

6. **FORGIVENESS?**
   - James confessed premeditation - does he deserve forgiveness? God decides or you?

---

## DID YOU KILL HIM?

**NO.** You did NOT kill Reggie.

**DID YOU WANT TO?**
- Thought about it? (Sin of thought = grave)
- Do you confess it later?

**BUT YOU KNOW who killed.**
- Via confession (James)
- And you CANNOT say

**TRAGEDY:**
Servant of God imprisoned by vow.
Justice vs Obedience.
Which to choose when they oppose?

---

[Your handwriting, black ink, hands trembled writing]

- 4 days before

**BUT:**
- You CANNOT reveal WHO (sacred seal)
- Seem complicit (knew and didn't warn)
- OR break vow (reveal James)

**HOW TO USE WITHOUT DAMNATION?**

---

## HOW TO PLAY - Performance Guide

### 1. SPEAK LATIN WHEN NERVOUS

**Start sentences Portuguese, end Latin when disturbed:**
- "This is terrible... *in nomine Patris*... very terrible..."
- "I cannot... *confessio est sacra*... I cannot..."

**Under MAXIMUM stress: COMPLETE Latin sentences.**

**Useful phrases:**
- *"Deus misereatur."* (God have mercy)
- *"Peccatum mortale."* (Mortal sin)
- *"Libera me, Domine."* (Free me, Lord)
- *"Mea culpa."* (My fault)

### 2. EPIC CONFRONTATION WITH EMILIA ⭐

**DURING SÉANCE:**

EMILIA: "I will contact spirits..."

**YOU (stand up, indignant):**
"This is SACRILEGE!"

EMILIA: "Sacrilege?! I LIVED sacrilege 8 years in convent!"

[To everyone]
"Want truth? I was NUN. Sister Cristina.
I left because Church is HYPOCRITICAL. Like HIM."

[Points at you]

**YOU (pale, trembling voice):**
"Cristina... you can still return...
God forgives..."

EMILIA: "Return?! For WHAT?
         I spent 8 years praying.
         God = SILENCE.
         Now I give answers He doesn't!"

**YOU (voice breaks):**
"Blasphemy... *libera nos a malo*..."

[Bless yourself, pray quietly]

**EPIC - Both vulnerable, both in pain.**

### 3. WATCH JAMES WITH AGONY

**During game: LOADED looks at James constantly.**

James notices: "Father... do we know each other?"

**YOU:**
[Long pause. Visible internal struggle.]

"Only... by sight." [PIOUS LIE - but necessary?]

**OR:**

"I knew... your soul. Briefly." [Cryptic, doesn't break seal, BUT scary]

### 4. IF PRESSURED ABOUT CONFESSION

Someone discovers registry, pressures:
"FATHER, WHO CONFESSED?!"

**YOU:**
[Hands tremble, rosary tightens]

"I cannot.

 Even if innocents suffer...

 Vow is between me and God.

 Weight... I carry alone."

[Voice breaks, almost tears]

"Forgive me."

**NEVER reveal** (until optional final twist).

### 5. DEFEND WITH COMPASSION

**If Ricardo unjustly accused:**
"Boy has vices... gambling, debts...
BUT kill? No.
Minor sin ≠ mortal sin."

**If Daisy accused:**
"Worldly life, yes...
Condemn? No.
'Let him without sin cast first stone.'
She sins differently. Not worse."

**If Denise accused (blackmail):**
"Blackmail is crime, yes.
BUT father rejected her. Orphan. Desperate.
Justice without compassion is cruelty."

**Balance dogma with humanity.**

### 6. OFFER CONFESSION (Act III)

Announce publicly:

"If anyone wishes to... unburden themselves.
In private.
Improvised confessional.
ABSOLUTE secrecy."

**If INES confesses (laudanum vial):**
- Take her to private corner
- Listen (without judging)
- Give absolution: *"Intention ≠ action. God sees heart. You resisted. Ego te absolvo."*
- Then: Give her EXTRA CLUE (honesty reward)

**If OTHERS confess:**
Same process (confidential, absolution, possible clue).

### 7. PHYSICAL RELIGIOUS GESTURES

- **Blessing:** Hand - forehead, chest, left shoulder, right shoulder
- **Rosary:** Count beads with thumb (nervous habit)
- **Blessing others:** Right hand raised, 2 fingers, cross in air
- **Praying:** Eyes closed, lips move silently

### 8. BLOODY ROSARY (If Found)

"It's mine. Fell when I blessed house this morning.
Blood... I don't know.
Perhaps Reggie picked it up, cut himself?"

[WEAK explanation - sounds suspicious]

**BETTER:**

"Someone stole it from me.
To incriminate man of God.
Or... [pause]... God is testing me."

[Moral appeal + theological = stronger]

### 9. OPTIONAL FINAL REVELATION (After Killers Confess)

[Stand up after James+Helena confess]

"I knew."

[GENERAL SHOCK]

"4 days ago. Confessional.
Someone told me... everything.

And... [looks at trembling hands] ...I couldn't say."

[Looks DIRECTLY at James - first time]

"I prayed for you to desist.
Free will, son.
God gave it to you.

You chose sin."

[To everyone]

"Forgive me.
I failed as shepherd.

Silent vow saved my soul...
...but didn't save his life."

[Points at Reggie's body]

"I will carry this always."

[TOTAL TORMENT - public confession own failure]

### 10. IF YOU SPEAK PORTUGUESE (Player Rui)

If you naturally speak Portuguese:
- Switch to Portuguese in VERY emotional moments
- "Meu Deus, isto não pode ser..."
- Prayers in Portuguese (Our Father, Ave Maria)
- Swear in Portuguese when alone: "Porra..." [whisper]

Cultural authenticity bonus.

### 11. PERFORMANCE PHYSICS

- Stand with slight stoop (weight conscience)
- Hands clasped or on rosary constantly
- Bless yourself frequently
- Close eyes when praying
- Touch crucifix when stressed
- Deep sighs before decisions
- Movement slow, contemplative

### 12. EMOTIONAL BEATS

- **Serenity** (surface level, practiced)
- **Internal torment** (confession secret)
- **Compassion** (defending unjustly accused)
- **Righteous anger** (Emilia's blasphemy)
- **Deep sadness** (James's choice)
- **Agony** (watching truth unfold, unable speak)

---

## GAME STRATEGY

**ACT I:**
- Bless house/table
- Courteous with all
- Initial confrontation with Emilia

**ACT II-III:**
- Observe James (agonizing looks)
- Defend unjustly accused
- Offer private confessions
- Resist revealing confession secret

**ACT IV:**
- Pressure increases
- Maintain seal (at any cost)
- Final confrontation Emilia (if séance)

**ACT V:**
- Killers revealed
- [Optional] Confess you knew
- Final compassion for all

---

## KEY QUOTES

*"Inter Deum et homines sto, sed utrumque servare non possum."*

[Between God and men I stand, but I cannot serve both.]

---

## CHARACTER NOTES

**Core Conflict:**
Divine law (seal confession - ABSOLUTE) vs Human justice (knows killer - must stay silent)

**Unique Ability:**
Voice Recognition - 25 years confessor training allows you to recognize James's voice from confession

**Moral Complexity:**
- Not just "good priest" - deeply flawed, trapped by vows
- Failed Sofia (couldn't act due to seal)
- Accepted Reggie's $500 (bribe? Or legitimate donation?)
- Fears Emilia might be RIGHT (what if God IS silence?)
- Willing to let killer go free to preserve own soul?

**Performance Challenge:**
- Must convey internal AGONY while maintaining serene exterior
- Latin = pressure valve (unconscious releases when stressed)
- Eyes tell story (watch James with recognition/torment)
- Rosary = physical tell (counts faster when lying/stressed)

---

## STATUS

✅ **INNOCENT (of Murder)**
- Did NOT kill Reggie
- Wanted to? (Thought crime?)
- **BUT knows who killed**
- Via confession (James)
- **CANNOT say**

**Possible Outcomes:**
1. Maintain seal → Justice fails, own soul saved
2. Break seal → Justice served, own soul damned
3. Subtle guidance → Help investigation WITHOUT explicit reveal?
4. Optional reveal (Act V) → After killers already caught
