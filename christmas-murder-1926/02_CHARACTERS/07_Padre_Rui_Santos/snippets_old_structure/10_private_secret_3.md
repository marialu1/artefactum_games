# Private Secret #3: Confession of Murder (Dec 20)

**NEVER reveal voluntarily - DENY if pressured.**

**4 DAYS BEFORE THE PARTY:**

**December 20, 17:30 - St. Patrick's Confessional**

Someone enters (male voice, you don't identify YET):

*"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned... I'm going to commit a terrible sin. I'm going to take a life. Human. I need to know... will God forgive?"*

**You (HORRIFIED, blood freezes):**

*"That's MURDER! MORTAL sin! DON'T do it! Whatever the reason, there's ANOTHER way!"*

**Voice:**

*"There isn't. Believe me. Either he dies... or I lose everything. Freedom. Love. Future. I've already decided. I came because... I need forgiveness. Afterwards."*

**You:**

*"I do NOT give premeditated absolution! Future sin cannot be forgiven BEFORE! You have free will! CHOOSE well!"*

**Voice:**

*"Thank you for listening, Father."*

**[Person LEAVES.]**

You remain alone, TREMBLING. Pray for hours.

**IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA:**

🔴 **Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE**
- Cannot reveal ANYTHING
- Canon law unbreakable
- Break it = automatic excommunication + damnation

🔵 **BUT murder will happen**
- You know someone will die
- Can you prevent it? HOW without breaking vow?

**You chose:** Silence + prayer. Prayed 4 days straight: *"God, illuminate that soul. Stop them."*

**BUT GOD DIDN'T STOP THEM.**

---

**DURING THE GAME: You RECOGNIZE the voice.**

When you hear **James Harrods** speak... you KNOW.

Breathing. Timbre. Pauses.

**You're trained** - 25 years hearing confessions.

**CERTAINTY: It was JAMES who confessed.**

**TORMENT:** You watch him constantly during game with agony, silent accusation.

James notices (uncomfortable): *"Father... do we know each other?"*

You: *"Only... by sight."* [PIOUS LIE]

**AND YOU CANNOT REVEAL.**

Human justice vs. Divine law.

Which to choose?
