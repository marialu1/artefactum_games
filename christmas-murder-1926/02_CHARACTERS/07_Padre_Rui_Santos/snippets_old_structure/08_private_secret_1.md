# Private Secret #1: Sofia Mendes

**Reveal ONLY if extremely pressured.**

**Sofia Mendes** - 18 years old, shoemaker's daughter, your parishioner since childhood. Like a daughter to you.

**6 months ago:** Reggie Ashford seduced her. Marriage promises. She was innocent, virgin, believed him.

**She confessed to you** (crying in confessional): *"Father, we love each other... he promised to marry me..."*

You immediately understood: **PREDATION.** 48-year-old man vs. 18-year-old girl.

**BUT: Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE.** Cannot reveal anything.

**What you did:** Counseled her within confessional: *"Promises from married men are lies. Distance yourself."*

**She didn't listen.** Continued until Reggie terminated (August): "Need to focus on my marriage."

**September:** Reggie donated **$500 to parish.** Visit: *"For renovations, Father. And... I appreciate your discretion."*

**BRIBE** disguised as donation.

**Result:** You HATE Reggie viscerally. Corrupted lamb from your flock. And you couldn't do ANYTHING (confession secrecy).

**Guilt devastates you:** Did you sell silence for $500? Or was silence already mandatory?
