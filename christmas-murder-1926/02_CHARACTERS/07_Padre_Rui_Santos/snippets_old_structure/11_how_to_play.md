# How to Play Father Juan Carlos

## Core Performance Elements

### 1. Speak Latin When Nervous ⭐
Start sentences in Portuguese/English, finish in Latin when disturbed:
- "This is terrible... *in nomine Patris*..."
- "I cannot... *confessio est sacra*..."

**Useful Latin phrases:**
- *"Deus misereatur"* (God have mercy)
- *"Peccatum mortale"* (Mortal sin)
- *"Libera me, Domine"* (Free me, Lord)
- *"Mea culpa"* (My fault)

### 2. Watch James with Agony
During game: INTENSE stares at James Harrods.

When he notices: 
- Long pause... *"Only... by sight."*
- OR: *"I knew... your soul. Briefly."* [cryptic]

### 3. Confrontation with Emilia (During Séance) 🎭
**EMILIA:** "I'll contact spirits..."

**YOU (standing):** "This is SACRILEGE!"

**EMILIA:** "Sacrilege?! I LIVED sacrilege 8 years! I was a NUN. Sister Cristina. I left because the Church is HYPOCRITICAL. Like HIM."

**YOU (trembling voice):** "Cristina... you can still return... God forgives..."

**EMILIA:** "Return?! For WHAT? God is SILENCE. I give answers HE doesn't!"

**[EPIC CONFRONTATION - both vulnerable]**

### 4. Physical Gestures
- **Bless yourself:** Hand - forehead, chest, left shoulder, right shoulder
- **Rosary:** Count beads with thumbs while praying
- **Prayer:** Eyes closed, lips move silently
- **Before decisions:** Deep sigh

### 5. If Pressured About Confession
"I cannot. Even if innocents suffer... the vow is between me and God. The weight... I carry alone."

**[Voice breaks, hands tremble]**

**NEVER reveal** (until optional finale).

### 6. Defend with Compassion
**If Ricardo accused unjustly:**
"The boy has vices... gambling, debts... BUT kill? No. Minor sin ≠ mortal sin."

**If Daisy accused:**
"Worldly life, yes... Do I condemn? No. 'Let those without sin cast the first stone.'"

**If Denise accused:**
"Blackmail is crime, yes. BUT father rejected her. Orphan. Desperate. Justice without compassion is cruelty."

### 7. Offer Confession (Act III)
Announce publicly:
"If anyone wishes... to unburden. In private. ABSOLUTE secrecy."

**If Claire confesses (laudanum flask):**
- Take her to private corner
- Listen without judgment
- Give absolution: "Intention ≠ action. *Ego te absolvo.*"
- Give her extra clue (honesty reward)

## Act-by-Act Strategy

- Bless house/table
- Courteous with everyone

**ACTS II-III:**
- Observe James (agonized stares)

**ACT IV:**

**ACT V:**

## Optional Final Revelation
After James + Helena confess:

[Long silence. Then YOU stand.]

"I knew."

[GENERAL SHOCK]

"4 days ago. Confessional. Someone told me... everything. And... [look at trembling hands] ...I couldn't say."

[Look DIRECTLY at James - first time]

"I prayed you'd change your mind. Free will, son. God gave it to you. You chose sin."

[To everyone]

"Forgive me. I failed as shepherd."

[TOTAL TORMENT - own public confession]

## Key Mannerisms Checklist

## Your Dilemma
