# Private Secret #2: Emilia = Sister Cristina

**Reveal ONLY if discovered/necessary.**

**Emilia Harrods** = former **Sister Cristina** (nun at Convent of Santa Clara, Newark).

You've known her since **1910** (same diocese).

**1910-1918:** She was devout nun. Perpetual vows (poverty, chastity, obedience). Contemplative life dedicated to God.

**1918: THE FALL**

Sister Cristina met James Harrods (donation to convent). **FELL IN LOVE.**

She came to you (tormented): *"Father Rui... I feel something... for a man... I know it's sin..."*

**You tried to save her:**

*"Cristina, these are PERPETUAL VOWS! You married God! This is temptation. The devil testing you. Pray. Fast. RESIST."*

**She:** *"I tried, Father. Months. I can't. He makes me feel... alive. God... is silence. I'm leaving."*

**You (desperate):** *"If you leave, you BETRAY God! Vows cannot be broken! Eternal damnation, Cristina! For a MAN?!"*

**She:** *"I prefer damnation with love... than salvation in solitude."*

**SHE LEFT.** Married James 6 months later (1918).

**SINCE THEN:**

To you = **FALLEN SISTER.** Betrayed God. Broke sacred vows. Now pretends to speak with dead (BLASPHEMY).

**CURRENT RIVALRY:**

It's not just "charlatan vs. priest."

It's **"fallen sister vs. brother who stayed."**

- YOU: represent everything she abandoned (faith, sacrifice, obedience)
- SHE: represents your secret fear (What if God really is silence? What if human love > divine love?)

**Deep pain:** He was friends with her (within religious limits). Failed to save her. Or... did she choose free will?
