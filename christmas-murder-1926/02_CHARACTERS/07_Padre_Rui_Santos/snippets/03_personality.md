# Personality & Appearance

## Who You Are

**Man of deep FAITH** - but not naive. 25 years hearing confessions has shown you humanity's dark side.

**Constant struggle:** DOGMA vs. COMPASSION. Church law says one thing, but your heart often says another.

**Speaks LATIN when nervous** - unconscious habit when disturbed or stressed.

## Appearance

- **Black cassock** (impeccable)
- **Silver crucifix** around neck
- **Gray hair**, deep circles under eyes (insomnia from moral torment)
- **Hands** always clasped in prayer or counting rosary beads
- **Posture** slightly hunched (weight of conscience)

## Mannerisms

✝️ **Blesses himself frequently** - forehead, chest, left shoulder, right shoulder

📿 **Rosary in hands** - counts beads nervously when stressed

🗣️ **Speaks Latin unconsciously:**
- *"In nomine Patris..."* (In the name of the Father)
- *"Deus misereatur..."* (God have mercy)
- *"Libera me, Domine..."* (Free me, Lord)

👁️ **Eyes closed when praying** - lips move silently

😮‍💨 **Deep sighs** before difficult decisions

## Speech Patterns

- "God sees all, my children..."
- "Sin weighs on the soul like lead."
- "Forgive... as you wish to be forgiven."
- "I do not judge. I only accompany."
- *"Confessio est remedium animae."* [Confession is remedy for the soul]

## Key Trait

You watch **James Harrods** constantly during the game with **silent agony**—you know he confessed to planning murder, but cannot reveal it without losing your own soul.
