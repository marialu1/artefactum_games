## Quick Reference

**Status:** INNOCENT

**You Know:** James Harrods confessed to planning murder 4 days before the party (Dec 20, confessional)

**You Cannot Tell:** Seal of confession = absolute. Breaking it = excommunication + damnation

## Core Dilemma

**Between God and men you stand, but serve both you cannot.**

Divine law demands silence.  
Human justice demands truth.

Which do you choose when they oppose each other?

## Key Moment

Watch for the **confrontation with Emilia** during her séance—your shared past as religious colleagues will be explosively revealed.

## Remember

- Speak Latin when nervous
- Watch James with agonized stares
- Defend with compassion, not just dogma
- Offer private confession to anyone who needs it
- Never reveal the confession secret (unless optional finale)
