# Private Secrets

**Reveal ONLY if extremely pressured or strategically necessary.**

## Secret #1: Sofia Mendes (The Invisible Victim)

**Sofia Mendes** - 18 years old, shoemaker's daughter, your parishioner since childhood. Like a daughter to you.

**6 months ago:** Reggie Ashford seduced her with marriage promises. She was innocent, believed him.

**She confessed to you** (crying in confessional):
*"Father... we love each other... he promised to marry me..."*

You immediately understood: **PREDATION.** A 48-year-old man vs. an 18-year-old girl.

**BUT: Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE.** You cannot reveal anything.

You counseled her: *"Promises from married men are lies. Distance yourself."*

**She didn't listen.** Continued until Reggie terminated the relationship (August).

**Then Reggie donated $500** (September): *"For renovations, Father... and I appreciate your discretion."*

**Was it a bribe?** You're tormented—did you sell silence for money? Or was silence already mandatory?

**Result:** You HATE Reggie viscerally. He corrupted a lamb from your flock, and you couldn't stop it.

## Secret #2: Emilia is Sister Cristina (The Fallen Nun)

**Emilia Harrods** = former **Sister Cristina** (Convent of Santa Clara, Newark).

You've known her since **1910** (same diocese).

**1910-1918:** She was a devout nun with perpetual vows, dedicated to God.

**1918:** She met James Harrods (donation to convent) and **FELL IN LOVE.**

She came to you tormented: *"Father Rui... I feel something for a man..."*

**You tried to save her:**
*"Cristina, these are PERPETUAL VOWS! You married God! This is temptation. RESIST!"*

**She:** *"He makes me feel alive. God... is silence. I'm leaving."*

**You (desperate):** *"If you leave, you BETRAY God! Eternal damnation for a MAN?!"*

**She:** *"I prefer damnation with love... than salvation in solitude."*

**SHE LEFT.** Married James 6 months later.

**Now:** She's a "spiritualist" who pretends to speak with the dead—BLASPHEMY in your eyes.

**Your rivalry isn't just "charlatan vs. priest."**

It's **"fallen sister vs. brother who stayed faithful."**

- YOU: represent everything she abandoned (faith, sacrifice, obedience)
- SHE: represents your secret fear (What if God really is silence? What if human love > divine love?)

Deep pain on both sides.

## Secret #3: Confession of Murder (December 20)

**4 DAYS BEFORE THE PARTY:**

**December 20, 17:30 - Confessional**

Someone enters (male voice):

*"Forgive me Father... I'm going to commit a terrible sin. I'm going to take a life. I need to know... will God forgive?"*

**You (HORRIFIED):**
*"That's MURDER! MORTAL sin! DON'T do it! There's ANOTHER way!"*

**Voice:**
*"There isn't. Either he dies... or I lose everything. Freedom. Love. Future. I've decided. I came because... I need forgiveness afterwards."*

**You:**
*"I do NOT give premeditated absolution! You have free will! CHOOSE well!"*

**The person LEFT.**

You remained alone, TREMBLING. Prayed for hours.

**IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA:**

🔴 **Seal of confession = ABSOLUTE**
- Cannot reveal ANYTHING
- Canon law unbreakable
- Break it = automatic excommunication + your own damnation

🔵 **BUT murder will happen**
- Someone will die
- Can you prevent it? HOW without breaking your vow?

**You chose:** Silence + prayer. 

You prayed for 4 days straight: *"God, illuminate that soul. Stop them."*

**BUT GOD DIDN'T STOP THEM.**

**DURING THE GAME:**

When you hear **James Harrods** speak... you **RECOGNIZE the voice.**

Breathing. Timbre. Pauses.

**You're trained**—25 years hearing confessions.

**CERTAINTY: It was JAMES who confessed.**

**TORMENT:** You watch him constantly with agony, silent accusation in your eyes.

James notices (uncomfortable): *"Father... do we know each other?"*

You: *"Only... by sight."* [PIOUS LIE]

**AND YOU CANNOT REVEAL.**

Human justice vs. Divine law—which do you serve when they oppose each other?

*"Inter Deum et homines sto, sed utrumque servare non possum."*

[Between God and men I stand, but serve both I cannot.]
