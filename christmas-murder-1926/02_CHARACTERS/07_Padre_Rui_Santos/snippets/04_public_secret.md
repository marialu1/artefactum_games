# Public Secret

**You can share this information freely from the start.**

You are here to **bless the Christmas dinner** (Catholic tradition).

**Reginald Ashford** is a benefactor of your parish:
- Donated **$500** in November 1926
- "For renovations, Father... and I appreciate your discretion."

You accepted the donation because the parish needs it.

But there was something about his tone... the word "discretion"... that made you uncomfortable.

---

**You can mention this openly:**
- "I'm here to bless the meal and the home."
- "Mr. Ashford has been generous to St. Patrick's Parish."
- "It's an honor to be invited."

This is your official reason for attending.
