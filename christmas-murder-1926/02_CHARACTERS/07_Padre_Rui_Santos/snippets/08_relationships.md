# Relationships

## 🔴 EMILIA HARRODS (Ex-Nun/Spiritual Rival)

**INTENSE PERSONAL RIVALRY.**

She = Sister Cristina, the nun who abandoned her vows for James in 1918.

You tried to save her. She chose love over God.

**Now she's a "spiritualist"**—pretends to speak with the dead. BLASPHEMY.

**Your rivalry = "fallen sister vs. brother who stayed."**

- YOU: everything she abandoned (faith, sacrifice, obedience)
- SHE: your secret fear (What if God is silence? What if human love > divine love?)

**Theological war constant. Mutual pain hidden.**

---

## 🟢 JOÃO CARLOS MENDES (Moral Ally)

**Law vs. Faith = mutual respect.**

You both seek JUSTICE (different methods).

Interesting, deep conversations.

Potential collaboration in investigation—he respects your integrity.

---

## 🔴 JAMES HARRODS (The Penitent/Killer)

**He confessed premeditated murder to you (Dec 20).**

**YOU KNOW he killed Reggie.**

**You CANNOT tell anyone.**

You watch him constantly with agony, silent accusation.

He feels your stare (uncomfortable).

**This is your central torment.**

---

## 🔴 REGINALD ASHFORD (Victim/Predator)

**You HATED him.**

He corrupted Sofia (like a daughter to you).

$500 donation felt like bribery.

Visceral hatred—but priests shouldn't hate.

Did you think about killing him? (Sin of thought = must confess later)

---

## 🟡 HELENA ASHFORD (Wounded Soul?)

Courteous respect.

You suspect she suffers (abusive marriage visible to pastoral eye).

Compassion for her pain.

---

## 🔵 DAISY VALMONT (Public Sinner)

You disapprove of her "worldly life" (cabaret, men).

**BUT** Christian compassion—all are God's children.

"I don't cast the first stone."

---

## 🟡 MARIA FLETCHER (Distant Respect)

Respectful distance.

She writes about crime/sin.

You deal with sinners' souls.

Interesting parallel.

---

## 🟡 FILIPP MORETTI (Likeable Sinner)

He's a bootlegger (Prohibition = illegal).

**BUT** feeds families, has honor code.

Moral gray area—you treat him with respect.

Good heart despite profession.

---

## 🔵 INES BEAUMONT (Wounded Lamb)

You see innocence/pain in her.

If she confesses (laudanum), you give absolution + guidance.

Paternal compassion.

---

## 🟡 DENISE BEAUMONT (Lost Sheep)

Blackmailer, cynic.

**BUT also victim** (father rejected her).

Possibility of redemption?

Justice with compassion.

---

## 🟢 YOURSELF (Internal Conflict)

**Your greatest struggle = with yourself.**

**DOGMA** (confession seal absolute) **vs.** **COMPASSION** (save innocent lives)

Church law vs. human justice—when they contradict, which wins?

**This internal war defines your entire role.**
