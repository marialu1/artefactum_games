# How to Play

## Playing as Father Juan Carlos

### Core Strategy

You are **INNOCENT** but possess **TERRIBLE KNOWLEDGE**—you know who the killer is through confession, but cannot reveal it without damning your own soul.

Your challenge: **Guide others toward justice WITHOUT breaking your sacred vow.**

---

## Key Performance Tips

### 1. Speak Latin When Nervous

Shift to Latin when disturbed or stressed:

- *"Isto é terrível... in nomine Patris..."* (This is terrible... in the name of the Father)
- *"Não posso... confessio est sacra..."* (I cannot... confession is sacred)
- Under maximum stress: complete Latin sentences

**Useful Latin phrases:**
- *"Deus misereatur"* (God have mercy)
- *"Peccatum mortale"* (Mortal sin)
- *"Libera me, Domine"* (Free me, Lord)
- *"Mea culpa"* (My fault)

### 2. The Epic Confrontation with Emilia ⭐

**During her séance:**

**EMILIA:** "I'll contact the spirits..."

**YOU (standing):** "This is SACRILEGE!"

**EMILIA:** "Sacrilege?! I LIVED sacrilege for 8 years! I was a NUN. Sister Cristina. I left because the Church is HYPOCRITICAL. Like HIM." [points at you]

**YOU (trembling voice):** "Cristina... you can still return... God forgives..."

**EMILIA:** "Return?! For WHAT? God is SILENCE. I give the answers He doesn't!"

[EPIC CONFRONTATION—both vulnerable, both in pain]

This reveals your shared past and deep emotional wounds.

### 3. Watch James with Silent Agony

Throughout the game, stare at **James Harrods** with loaded, agonized looks.

When he notices:

**JAMES:** "Father... do we know each other?"

**YOU:** [long pause, internal struggle visible]
"Only... by sight."
[OR]
"I knew... your soul. Briefly." [cryptic, terrifying]

### 4. If Pressured About the Confession

**"FATHER, WHO CONFESSED?!"**

**YOU:** [hands tremble on rosary]

"I cannot.

Even if innocents suffer...

The vow is between me and God.

The weight... I carry alone."

[voice breaks, almost tears]

**NEVER reveal** (unless optional end twist).

### 5. Defend with Compassion

Balance dogma with mercy:

**If Ricardo accused unjustly:**
"The boy has vices... gambling, debts... but MURDER? No. Minor sin ≠ mortal sin."

**If Daisy accused:**
"Worldly life, yes... Do I condemn? No. 'Let him without sin cast the first stone.'"

**If Denise accused:**
"Blackmail is crime, yes. BUT her father rejected her. Orphan. Desperate. Justice without compassion is cruelty."

### 6. Offer Private Confession (Act III)

Announce publicly:

"If anyone wishes to... unburden themselves. In private. Absolute secrecy."

**If Claire confesses (laudanum vial):**
- Take her to private corner
- Listen without judging
- Grant absolution: "Intention ≠ action. *Ego te absolvo.*"
- Give her an extra clue (reward for honesty)

### 7. Physical Gestures

- **Blessing:** Hand to forehead, chest, left shoulder, right shoulder
- **Rosary:** Count beads with thumb nervously
- **Benediction:** Right hand raised, two fingers, cross in air
- **Prayer:** Eyes closed, lips moving silently

### 8. The Bloodstained Rosary (If Found)

"It's mine. It fell when I blessed the house this morning. Blood... I don't know. Perhaps Reggie picked it up, cut himself?"

[OR BETTER]

"Someone stole it. To incriminate a man of God."

### 9. Final Revelation (Optional—After Killers Confess)

[Stand after James + Helena are exposed]

"I knew.

Four days ago. Confessional.

And... I could not say."

[Look directly at James—first time]

"I prayed you would stop. Free will, my son. God gave it to you. You chose sin."

[To everyone]

"Forgive me. I failed as a shepherd."

[TOTAL TORMENT—public confession of your own failure]

### 10. If You Speak Portuguese

- Switch to Portuguese in highly emotional moments
- *"Meu Deus, isto não pode..."* (My God, this cannot...)
- Prayers in Portuguese (Pai Nosso, Ave Maria)
- Adds cultural authenticity

### 11. Reaction When Killers Revealed

When James + Helena confess:

[Pray quietly. Then:]

"They killed for love... and desperation.

Do I condemn? God condemns.

I... only lament."

[Look at James]

"You confessed 4 days ago. I asked you not to do it.

Now... consequences. Prison. Then... God judges.

I will pray for you. Even in prison. Forgiveness is still possible.

*Never* too late."

[Christian compassion to the end]

**You cannot serve both.**

This is your tragedy—and your role to play beautifully.

*"Inter Deum et homines sto, sed utrumque servare non possum."*

[Between God and men I stand, but serve both I cannot.]
