# Goals & Status

## Your Goals Tonight

1. **DO NOT BREAK CONFESSION SEAL**
   - Cost = your own soul, excommunication, damnation
   - No matter what happens

2. **BUT JUSTICE MUST PREVAIL**
   - How can you help without revealing?
   - Guide others toward truth without breaking your vow

3. **CONFRONT EMILIA**
   - Her séance = blasphemy
   - But also... opportunity to save her soul?

4. **GUIDE SOULS**
   - Your pastoral role continues even in chaos
   - Offer private confession to anyone who needs it

5. **ATONEMENT**
   - You failed Sofia (couldn't save her from Reggie)
   - Can you save others now?

6. **FORGIVENESS?**
   - James confessed premeditated murder
   - Does he deserve forgiveness? Does God decide, or do you?

## Status: INNOCENT

**You did NOT kill Reggie.**

You wanted to? You thought about it? (Thought = sin, must confess later)

**BUT you know who killed him.**

Through confession (James).

**AND YOU CANNOT TELL.**

---

## Your Impossible Position

**TRAGEDY:** A servant of God imprisoned by his own vow.

Justice vs. Obedience—when they oppose each other, which do you choose?

You carry the weight of this knowledge **alone**, in silence, while watching the investigation unfold around you.

*"The seal is heavier than the truth."*
