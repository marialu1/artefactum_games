## CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is James Harrods?**

**In Three Sentences:**

James Harrods is a **40-year-old successful banker** who appears to be the epitome of respectability: devoted husband to Emilia, father of two children, trusted financial advisor to Manhattan's elite. Beneath this perfect facade lies a man who **embezzled $15,000 in a desperate stock fraud scheme** that's about to be exposed, who fell **desperately in love with Helena Ashford** (his client's wife), and who—when cornered by Reggie's threats of exposure and prison—**helped strangle his blackmailer** with piano wire on Christmas Eve. He's **GUILTY of murder**, but his crime was born from **desperate love and existential terror**, making him a **tragic villain** rather than a monster.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Good Man Who Did Evil"**

James isn't naturally violent or cruel. He's actually kind, thoughtful, loyal—qualities that make his crime MORE horrifying. He loved his wife once. He adores his children. He never wanted to hurt anyone. BUT when faced with losing EVERYTHING (freedom, Helena, future), he convinced himself murder was the ONLY option. The tragedy: it wasn't. There were other choices. He just couldn't see them through his panic.

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I must look INNOCENT while hiding MASSIVE guilt. Every conversation is a tightrope. Every question is a trap. And when finally caught... do I feel relief or just... emptiness?"*

## PERSONALITY

### TEMPERAMENT

**Core Traits:**

1. **CONTROLLED (External Calm, Internal Chaos)**
   - Surface: composed, professional, unflappable
   - Reality: constant anxiety, screaming internally
   - Banking trained him: never show fear to clients
   - Now: uses same mask to hide murder guilt

2. **ANALYTICAL (Thinks Everything Through)**
   - Natural problem-solver (numbers, logic, planning)
   - Planned murder like business transaction (cold calculation)
   - BUT emotions complicate: love for Helena = irrational factor
   - Post-murder: analyzing every word, every look (paranoid precision)

3. **LOYAL (To Fault)**
   - Once committed, NEVER wavers (strength and weakness)
   - Loyal to Emilia for 8 years (even when love faded)
   - Loyal to Helena NOW (would die for her)
   - Loyal to children (guilt about what he's done to them)
   - This loyalty made him CAPABLE of murder (protecting Helena)

4. **COMPARTMENTALIZED (Lives Multiple Lives)**
   - **Banker James:** Professional, trustworthy, conservative
   - **Husband James:** Dutiful, present (but emotionally absent)
   - **Father James:** Loving, playful, genuinely joyful
   - **Lover James:** Passionate, vulnerable, alive
   - **Killer James:** Cold, efficient, desperate
   - Switches between roles seamlessly (terrifying skill)

5. **QUIETLY DESPERATE (Drowning, Pretending to Swim)**
   - Not dramatic about suffering (unlike Daisy/Helena)
   - Internalizes pain (stomach ulcers, insomnia, silent panic)
   - Coping mechanism: work harder, control more, plan everything
   - Breaking point reached: murder was "logical solution"

### EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE

**Surface (What Others See):**
- Professional, courteous, slightly boring
- Dutiful husband, loving father
- Reliable, trustworthy, safe
- Maybe a bit stressed (work pressures) but fine

**Depth (What's Hidden):**
- Terror (prison looms, children will lose father)
- Guilt (murdered someone, betrayed wife, destroyed lives)
- Love (Helena consumes him, first time feeling ALIVE)
- Shame (he's become what he despised: criminal, adulterer, killer)
- Exhaustion (maintaining facade is slowly killing him)

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- **Work:** Buries himself in numbers (safe, logical world)
- **Control:** Plans everything obsessively (illusion of safety)
- **Compartmentalization:** Locks emotions in boxes (don't think, don't feel)
- **Helena:** She's his escape, his reason, his drug (unhealthy dependency)

### SPEECH PATTERNS

**Vocabulary:**
- Financial terms even in casual conversation:
  - "That's a sound investment of time"
  - "We need to balance the accounts here"
  - "Let's calculate the risk"
- Professional jargon: "per se," "as it were," "one might say"
- Formal grammar (never contractions in professional mode)

**Cadence:**
- **Slow, measured** (thinks before speaking)
- **Pauses** for precision (chooses words carefully)
- **Even tone** (rarely raises voice, even when should)
- **Shorter sentences** when stressed (control slipping)

**Signature Phrases:**
- "Let's approach this logically..."
- "In my professional opinion..."
- "One must consider all variables..."
- "The prudent course would be..."
- "I've thought this through quite carefully."

**When Lying (Subtle Tells):**
- Over-explains (adds unnecessary detail)
- More formal language (retreat to professional mode)
- Touches wedding ring (unconscious guilt tell)
- Longer pauses (calculating story)
- References logic/analysis (hiding behind rationality)

**When Genuine (Rare):**
- Voice softens (loses professional edge)
- Simpler words (drops jargon)
- Shows emotion (fear, love, pain bleeds through)
- Faster speech (control gone)
- "I..." statements (personal, vulnerable)

### MANNERISMS

**Physical Tells:**

1. **Wedding Ring Twisting** (Guilt/Anxiety Tell)
   - **When:** Lying about affair, thinking of Emilia, guilt overwhelming
   - **How:** Right hand unconsciously twists ring on left hand
   - **Frequency:** Increases with stress
   - **Meaning:** Tactile reminder of betrayal

2. **Pocket Watch Checking** (Control Ritual)
   - **When:** Needs to feel in control, anxious, buying time
   - **How:** Pulls watch, checks time (even if irrelevant)
   - **Purpose:** Familiar action = grounding
   - **Note:** Inherited from father = connection to "good" self

3. **Precise Gestures** (Banker's Training)
   - Hands form steeple when thinking (professorial)
   - Adjusts cufflinks (nervous habit disguised as grooming)
   - Straightens already-straight objects (need for order)

4. **Posture Maintenance** (Military Discipline)
   - Never slouches (even when exhausted)
   - Shoulders back, spine straight (armor of respectability)
   - Breaks ONLY when alone with Helena (vulnerable posture)

5. **Minimal Expression** (Controlled Face)
   - Warm smile for clients/friends (practiced, perfect)
   - Neutral face when thinking (blank slate)
   - Micro-expressions slip through when stressed:
     - Eye twitches when lying
     - Jaw clenches when angry
     - Swallows hard when terrified

**Habitual Actions:**
- Adjusts glasses (even though doesn't wear them—phantom gesture)
- Smooths tie (comfort action, checking appearance)
- Clears throat before important statements (buys thinking time)
- Stands when lady enters room (old-fashioned courtesy)

**Stress Responses:**
- Voice gets QUIETER (not louder—implodes, doesn't explode)
- Movements more precise (over-control compensating)
- More financial terminology (retreat to safe language)
- Physical stillness (freeze response, not flight/fight)

## PUBLIC SECRET

### WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Professional Connection:**
- "I manage some of Mr. Ashford's investment portfolio."
- Business associate for 2+ years
- Recently partnered on speakeasy investment (with Filipp)
- Occasional social engagements (clubs, dinners)

✅ **Recent Financial Stress:**
- "Markets have been... challenging lately."
- Some clients lost money (economic downturn 1926)
- Pressure to maintain returns
- Working long hours (family notices)

✅ **Family Man Status:**
- Wife Emilia (spiritualist, good woman)
- Two young children (Tomás & Maria)
- Devoted father (genuinely true)
- Stable marriage (LIE but public story)

### STRATEGIC USE

**Why This Is Useful:**

1. **Establishes Normalcy** (You're boring, stable, safe = invisible)
2. **Explains Presence** (Business associate = legitimate reason here)
3. **Creates Cover** (Family man = "would never" commit crime)
4. **Deflects Suspicion** (Successful banker = no motive for murder)

**Delivery:**
Present this information **NATURALLY** when asked, **NEVER volunteer** (draw attention by absence, not presence):

SOMEONE: "How do you know Mr. Ashford?"

JAMES: "Business, primarily. I manage some of his investment accounts. He's been a valued client for several years."

[Pause, slight smile]

"Though I must admit, his taste for risk sometimes exceeds my comfort level. Conservative banking and all that."

[Small chuckle—disarming]

## PRIVATE SECRETS

### 🔴 SECRET #1: THE STOCK FRAUD ($15,000 EMBEZZLEMENT)

**THE CRIME THAT STARTED EVERYTHING**

#### **How It Began (January-June 1926)**

**The Problem:**

**January 1926:**
- Client: Mrs. Dorothy Whitmore (elderly widow, $50,000 portfolio)
- Request: "Conservative investments, no risk, preserve capital"
- James's promise: "Safe as houses, Mrs. Whitmore"

**But Then:**

**February 1926:**
- Market opportunity: Speculative railroad stock (high risk, high reward)
- James's thought: "If I invest HER money... and it pays off... I'll return it plus profits. She'll never know."
- Rationalization: "It's only temporary. Two months maximum."

**March 1926:**
- Invested $15,000 of Mrs. Whitmore's conservative portfolio
- Into risky railroad speculation
- Without her knowledge or consent
- **This is embezzlement** (even if intending to return it)

**The Disaster:**

**April-May 1926:**
- Railroad company FAILS (corruption scandal)
- Stock CRASHES (worthless overnight)
- $15,000 GONE (completely lost)

**June 1926:**
- Mrs. Whitmore requests quarterly report
- James PANICS: How to explain missing $15,000?
- Decision: **FORGE DOCUMENTS** (cover up loss with fake statements)
- Now: Embezzlement + fraud + forgery (three crimes)

#### **The Cover-Up (June-December 1926)**

**The Juggling Act:**

James needed to:
1. Create fake statements (showing non-existent gains)
2. Prepare for eventual audit (would be discovered)
3. Find $15,000 somehow (impossible on his salary)
4. Live with guilt (destroying him internally)

**Desperation Moves:**

**July-August 1926:**
- Borrowed from other accounts (robbing Peter to pay Paul)
- Deeper into fraud (now multiple clients affected)
- Sleepless nights (ulcers, panic attacks)

**September 1926:**
- Speakeasy investment with Filipp ($8,000)
- Thought: "If this pays off, I can cover some losses"
- Reality: Too little, too late

**October-November 1926:**
- Considered confessing (to Emilia? To police? To Reggie?)
- Couldn't (shame, prison, children's future)
- Kept digging deeper (more forgeries, more lies)

#### **Reggie's Discovery (December 19, 1926)**

**How He Found Out:**

**December 15-18, 1926:**
- Reggie's accountant: routine audit of Reggie's accounts
- James manages SOME of Reggie's money too
- Accountant notices: discrepancies, unusual transactions
- Reports to Reggie: "Mr. Harrods's numbers don't add up"

**December 19, 1926 (Morning):**

REGGIE calls James to office:

"James. Sit down."

[Shows documents]

"Explain these discrepancies."

JAMES: [Blood runs cold] "I... there must be some clerical error—"

REGGIE: "Clerical error of $15,000? From Mrs. Whitmore's account?"

[Pause]

"You embezzled. You forged documents. You committed fraud."

JAMES: [Breaks down] "I was going to replace it. The railroad stock—"

REGGIE: "Railroad stock? You gambled a WIDOW'S money on SPECULATION?!"

[Cold fury]

"I have the evidence. Documented. Witnessed by my accountant."

JAMES: "Please, Reggie, my family—"

REGGIE: "Should have thought of that before you became a thief."

**The Sentence:**

REGGIE: "Here's what happens now:

1. You confess to authorities (December 26, after Christmas)
2. You repay every cent (impossible but required)
3. You go to prison (10+ years, white-collar crime)
4. Your banking license: revoked forever
5. Your reputation: destroyed
6. Your family: disgraced

I'm giving you Christmas with your children. After that... you're done."

JAMES: [Destroyed] "Why wait? Why not turn me in now?"

REGGIE: "Because I'm not a monster. Your children deserve one last Christmas with their father."

[Cruel smile]

"Consider it my gift."

#### **Current Status (December 24, 1926)**

**What James Faces:**

- **In 48 hours:** Arrested, imprisoned
- **Prison sentence:** 10-15 years (financial crimes)
- **Age when released:** 50-55 years old (life over)
- **Career:** Destroyed (can never work in finance again)
- **Family:** Emilia will divorce him (justified)
- **Children:** Will grow up with "father in prison" shame
- **Reputation:** From respected banker to criminal

**His Mental State:**

- Suicidal thoughts (considered ending it, couldn't—children)
- Desperate rage (Reggie has power to ruin him, enjoys it)
- Trapped animal logic ("Either he dies... or I lose everything")
- Moral compromise: "Murder is evil... but so is destroying my family"

**The Rationalization:**

"If Reggie dies... evidence might disappear... maybe I can survive this..."

**The Truth:**

Murder won't erase evidence. Accountant still knows. Documents still exist.

But desperate men don't think clearly.

### 🔴 SECRET #2: THE AFFAIR WITH HELENA

**TIMELINE: December 1925 - December 1926 (One Full Year)**

#### **How It Began (December 1925)**

**The Meeting:**

**New Year's Eve 1925:**
- Business dinner at Gatsby Rose Manor
- James invited (manages some Ashford investments)
- Emilia NOT invited (Reggie: "Business, not social")

**First Real Encounter:**

HELENA (hostess): "Mr. Harrods, more champagne?"

JAMES: "Thank you, Mrs. Ashford."

[She pours, hands linger momentarily]

HELENA: "You must find these dinners dreadfully boring. My husband certainly does."

[Sad smile]

JAMES: [Surprised by vulnerability] "Not at all. Though I imagine hosting them is... taxing."

HELENA: "You have no idea."

[Looks at Reggie across room—flash of pain]

**That Moment:**

James saw:
- Beautiful woman (always knew, never mattered)
- Trapped (something in her eyes)
- Lonely (recognized it—he felt same)
- Connection (first time in years feeling SEEN)

Not love yet. But... spark.

**December 3, 1925:**

**Accidental Meeting:**
- Helena at bank (depositing household money)
- James sees her, greets professionally
- Small talk becomes... real talk

HELENA: "Do you ever feel like you're playing a part? Saying lines someone else wrote?"

JAMES: [Arrested by honesty] "Every single day."

**Coffee (Spontaneous):**

JAMES: "Would you... care for coffee? There's a café nearby."

HELENA: [Hesitates, then] "Yes. I'd like that very much."

**The Conversation That Changed Everything:**

One hour. Two people being HONEST for first time in years.

HELENA: "My marriage is a prison. Pretty bars, but prison nonetheless."

JAMES: "My marriage is... duty. I love my wife. But I'm not IN love anymore. Haven't been for years."

HELENA: "Do you think it's wrong? To want... more?"

JAMES: "I think it's human."

**The Goodbye:**

Neither planned to see each other again.

Both knew they would.

#### **The Affair Develops (December 1925 - August 1926)**

**Phase 1: Emotional Affair (Dec 1925 - Feb 1926)**

**Pattern:**
- "Accidental" meetings (bank, café, park)
- Long conversations (hours disappearing)
- Emotional intimacy (sharing fears, dreams, truths)
- NOT physical yet (but building)

**What They Found:**
- **James:** Woman who saw HIM (not just provider/banker)
- **Helena:** Man who listened (not controlled)
- **Both:** Permission to feel alive

**December 20, 1925:**

HELENA: "I think about you. Too much."

JAMES: "I think about you constantly."

[Pause]

HELENA: "What do we do?"

JAMES: "I don't know. But I know I can't stop."

**Phase 2: Physical Affair (February 1926 - December 1926)**

**First Kiss: February 14, 1926**

Valentine's Day (symbolic, inevitable):
- Met at rented apartment (James arranged)
- Pretense dropped
- "Just to talk" became much more

HELENA: "I've never felt this before. Never."

JAMES: "Neither have I. Never like this."

[Kiss]

**The Pattern (Feb-Dec 1926):**

**Frequency:**
- 2-3 times per week
- Afternoons (James "long lunch")
- Helena ("shopping," "visiting friends")

**Location:**
- Rented apartment (small, discrete)
- Neutral ground (their sanctuary)
- Where they could be REAL

**What It Was:**
- NOT just sex (though yes, that too)
- Emotional refuge (only place feeling safe)
- Future planning ("When we can be together...")
- Love (genuine, desperate, dangerous)

#### **The Love Was Real**

**Unlike Daisy & Reggie's affair (performative), this was GENUINE:**

**For James:**
- First time feeling PASSION in decade
- Helena made him feel ALIVE (not just functional)
- With her: not banker/husband/father (just JAMES)
- She was escape, oxygen, reason to exist

**For Helena:**
- First time experiencing REAL love (not control)
- James gentle, kind, respectful (opposite of Reggie)
- With him: not property/wife/decoration (just HELENA)
- He was freedom, hope, future

**The Tragic Irony:**

This beautiful love required DESTROYING:
- James's marriage (Emilia would be devastated)
- Helena's already-destroyed marriage (but killing it formally)
- James's career (affair with client's wife = breach of trust)
- Both reputations (scandal in 1926 = social death)

**BUT they didn't care.**

When you're drowning, you don't ask if the life raft is PROPER.

You just GRAB IT.

#### **The Plan to Be Together (Pre-Murder)**

**Their Dream:**

**August-November 1926:**
- Helena divorces Reggie (difficult but possible)
- James divorces Emilia (heartbreaking but necessary)
- Wait appropriate time (scandal dies down)
- Marry (finally together, finally free)

**The Problems:**

1. **Reggie wouldn't allow divorce** (controlled Helena legally)
2. **Helena had no money** (prenup gave her nothing)
3. **Social suicide** (1926 divorced women = pariahs)
4. **James's career** (affair with client's wife = ruined)
5. **The children** (Tomás & Maria would be destroyed)

**But they were PLANNING it anyway.**

Until...

#### **Everything Collapses (December 17-20, 1926)**

**December 17, 1926:**

Reggie discovers affair (hired private detective, followed Helena).

Confronts Helena privately:

REGGIE: "So. The banker. How predictable."

HELENA: [Terrified] "I don't know what—"

REGGIE: "Don't lie. I have photographs. Witnesses. Evidence."

[Cold]

"You thought you could leave me? I OWN you."

**December 19, 1926:**

Reggie discovers James's fraud (accountant report).

Confronts James (see Secret #1):

Now has TWO weapons:
1. Prison for James (fraud)
2. Public humiliation for Helena (affair photos)

**December 20, 1926 (Night):**

**The Meeting:**

James and Helena meet at apartment (emergency call).

HELENA: [Crying] "He knows. Everything."

JAMES: "I know. He... he's turning me in. December 26th."

[Pause]

HELENA: "Prison?"

JAMES: "10-15 years. Minimum."

[Both sitting in horror]

HELENA: "So that's it. We lose everything."

JAMES: "Unless..."

[Long pause]

"Unless he can't turn me in."

HELENA: [Understands] "You mean..."

JAMES: "If he were gone... evidence might disappear... we might..."

[Can't finish sentence]

HELENA: [Whisper] "Are you suggesting we...?"

JAMES: [Meets her eyes] "I'm suggesting we have no other choice."

**The Decision:**

**NOT made lightly. NOT made quickly.**

They sat for HOURS. Talking through:
- Other options (none viable)
- Moral weight (knew it was evil)
- Consequences if caught (both die/prison)
- Consequences if DON'T (both destroyed anyway)

**Finally:**

HELENA: "If we do this... and we're caught... at least we tried. At least we fought."

JAMES: "And if we DON'T... we definitely lose everything."

[Pause]

"I love you. More than life. More than morality. More than my own soul."

HELENA: "I love you. Enough to go to hell."

JAMES: "Then... we do this?"

HELENA: [Takes his hand] "We do this."

**Thus the murder plan was born.**

Not from evil. From desperate love.

### 🔴 SECRET #3: THE MURDER PLAN & EXECUTION

**THE CONSPIRACY (December 20-24, 1926)**

#### **Planning Phase (December 20-23, 1926)**

**December 20, 1926 (Night) - The Framework:**

After deciding to murder Reggie, they planned methodically:

**JAMES's Strengths:**
- Analytical mind (banking = strategy)
- Calm under pressure (client meetings = performance)
- Attention to detail (numbers don't lie, neither can they)

**HELENA's Strengths:**
- Access to Reggie (wife = no suspicion entering rooms)
- Knowledge of house layout (every room, every exit)
- Social control (party hostess = orchestrates movements)

**The Plan (Initial):**

1. **Timing:** Christmas Eve party (chaos = cover)
2. **Location:** Office (private, sound-proof)
3. **Lure:** Helena brings Reggie ("surprise for you")
4. **Method:** Strangulation (quiet, no gunshot)
5. **Staging:** Move body, create confusion
6. **Alibi:** Both visible at different times (don't disappear together)

**The Weapon:**

JAMES: "We need something... untraceable. Silent."

HELENA: "Piano wire? For strangling?"

JAMES: "Where would I even acquire that without suspicion?"

HELENA: "Filipp Moretti. He has jazz bands at his speakeasy."

JAMES: "I can say it's a gift... for musicians... plausible..."

**December 21, 1926 - Acquiring Weapon:**

James visits Filipp's speakeasy:

JAMES: "Filipp, might you help me with something unusual?"

FILIPP: "Always, amico. What do you need?"

JAMES: "Piano wire. High quality. I'm commissioning a custom gift for a jazz ensemble."

FILIPP: [No suspicion] "How much?"

JAMES: "Several feet. For stringing instruments."

FILIPP: "I know a supplier. Come back tomorrow."

**December 22, 1926:**

James retrieves piano wire. No questions asked.

Filipp will later realize: he provided MURDER WEAPON.

**December 22-23, 1926 - Rehearsal:**

At rented apartment, they PRACTICED:

**Physical Rehearsal:**
- How to approach from behind
- Where to place wire (throat, precise angle)
- How much force (they researched—morbidly)
- How long to maintain pressure (60 seconds minimum)
- What to do with body after

**Psychological Preparation:**

HELENA: "Can we really do this? Actually KILL someone?"

JAMES: "He's not just someone. He's the man threatening to destroy us."

HELENA: "But taking a life..."

JAMES: "Or losing ours. Those are the only options."

**Confessional (December 20, 1926):**

**James CONFESSED to Father Juan Carlos:**

(See Father Juan Carlos's dossier for full confession)

JAMES: [Confessional booth] "Father, I'm planning to commit murder."

PADRE RUI: [Shocked] "My son—"

JAMES: "I know it's evil. I know I'll damn myself. But I see no other path."

PADRE: "There is ALWAYS another path—"

JAMES: "Prison for ten years? My children growing up ashamed? The woman I love suffering under a tyrant forever? THAT is the other path."

[Pause]

"Forgive me, Father. But I've made my choice."

**Padre bound by confessional seal - CANNOT reveal.**

This added to James's guilt: He involved a holy man, forced him to carry this burden.

#### **The Murder Night (December 24, 1926)**

**See CRIME_SUMMARY.md for minute-by-minute breakdown.**

**Key Points for James's Experience:**

**19h45-20h08: The Waiting**

James arrived at party looking NORMAL:
- Greeted guests (professional smile)
- Chatted with Emilia (dutiful husband)
- Avoided Helena publicly (no suspicion)
- Positioned himself near office hallway (ready)

**Internal State:**
- Heart pounding (terror)
- Hands shaking slightly (hid in pockets)
- Mouth dry (kept drinking water)
- Mind racing ("Can I really do this? Must I? Yes. No choice.")

**20h09: The Signal**

Helena caught his eye across room. Nod.

Walked toward office hallway. Waited.

**20h10: Into Position**

Helena led Reggie to office:

"Darling, I have a surprise for you. Come see."

James already hidden behind door. Wire in hands.

**20h11-20h11:40: THE MURDER (40 Seconds of Hell)**

Reggie enters office. Helena closes door.

**20h11:00:**

REGGIE: "What's this surprise—"

JAMES: [Emerges from behind door]

REGGIE: "James?! What—"

**20h11:05:**

Both attack simultaneously.

James: Wire around neck from behind.

Helena: Holds Reggie's arms (prevents fighting).

**20h11:10-20h11:40:**

Reggie STRUGGLES. Hard.

- Tries to scream (wire too tight)
- Thrashes (Helena holds, James pulls)
- Eyes bulging (suffocating, terrified)
- Fights for FORTY SECONDS (feels like eternity)

**James's Experience:**

Every second: thinking "Stop fighting. Please just STOP."

Physically: Arms burning, muscles screaming.

Emotionally: Horror at what he's doing.

But doesn't stop. Can't stop. Won't stop.

**20h11:40:**

Reggie goes limp. Dead.

**20h11:45-20h14: THE AFTERMATH**

They release body. It slumps to floor.

Silence except their panting.

**JAMES:** [Staring at body] "Oh God. Oh God. We actually..."

**HELENA:** [Shaking violently] "We had to. We HAD to."

**JAMES:** [Looking at hands—wire still there] "I killed him. I'm a murderer."

**HELENA:** [Grabbing him] "WE killed him. Together. We're in this together."

**Both trembling, covered in sweat, can't believe what they've done.**

**20h12-20h14: Panic & Realization**

They almost BROKE. Almost ran. Almost confessed.

But survival instinct kicked in:

HELENA: "We have to... the staging. The punch bowl. Like we planned."

JAMES: [Nods, mechanical] "Yes. The plan. Follow the plan."

**20h15: Daisy's Song (Perfect Cover)**

As they prepare to move body, hear:

🎵 *"My funny valentine... sweet comic valentine..."* 🎵

Everyone's attention on performance. Perfect timing.

**20h15-20h16: Moving the Body**

- Drag Reggie from office
- Through hallway (Helena checks—coast clear)
- Into ballroom (everyone watching Daisy)
- Hoist into large punch bowl (heavy, awkward, horrible)

**20h16: The Staging**

Helena had acquired Christmas tree star topper earlier.

James pushes it into Reggie's head (makes staging look insane/random).

Trying to create confusion: drowning? Madness? Who would do this?

**20h16-20h17: Hasty Cleanup**

Race back to office:
- Wipe blood spots (missed some)
- Helena changes gloves (blood-stained originals hidden)
- Hide wire behind piano (hasty, not perfect)
- Compose themselves (straighten clothes, breathe)

**20h17:30:**

HELENA: [Whispers] "I love you. Whatever happens."

JAMES: [Kisses her forehead] "I love you. Always."

**20h18: The Performance**

Helena returns to ballroom. James waits 30 seconds, then follows separately.

Helena "discovers" body: **"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!!"**

James in hallway, comes running with everyone else.

Performs shock: "Good God! What happened?!"

### 🔴 SECRET #4: POST-MURDER GUILT & PSYCHOLOGY

**LIVING WITH MURDER (December 24, 1926 - Present)**

#### **The Immediate Aftermath (20h18-21h00)**

**External Performance:**

JAMES: [To group] "Everyone, please step back! Don't touch anything!"

[To JC, if present:] "Detective, this is clearly a crime scene."

[To Emilia:] "Darling, you shouldn't see this. Please, take the children upstairs."

Professional, controlled, helpful.

**Internal Reality:**

- Hyperaware of EVERYTHING (every glance, every word)
- Paranoid (do they suspect? Can they tell?)
- Dissociated (feels like watching himself from outside)
- Nauseous (wants to vomit but can't show weakness)

**The Guilt Waves:**

Coming in intervals:

**Wave 1:** "We did it. Holy God, we actually murdered someone."

**Wave 2:** "His eyes. The way he looked at me. Pleading."

**Wave 3:** "Helena's hands are blood-stained. Literally."

**Wave 4:** "I'm a FATHER. What have I become?"

**Wave 5:** "We're going to get caught. We're terrible at this."

#### **Managing Emilia (Heartbreaking)**

**The Worst Part:**

Emilia is INNOCENT. Loves James genuinely. Suspects NOTHING.

EMILIA: [During investigation] "James, darling, are you alright? You look pale."

JAMES: "I'm fine. Just... shocked by all this."

EMILIA: "Of course. It's so horrible." [Leans against him for comfort]

**James's Internal Monologue:**

*"She trusts me completely. She has no idea I'm monster. No idea I'm about to destroy her life. I'm holding her while smelling of another woman's perfume. While my hands still remember strangling someone. God forgive me. She won't. She shouldn't."*

#### **Secret Moments with Helena (Dangerous)**

Must NOT show connection publicly. But need reassurance.

**Brief Exchanges:**

HELENA: [Passing in hallway, whispered] "Are you alright?"

JAMES: [Whispered back] "Terrified. You?"

HELENA: "Same. But we'll survive this."

JAMES: "Together."

**Stolen Glances:**

Across ballroom, during investigation, they catch eyes.

Messages without words:
- *"I love you"*
- *"I'm scared"*
- *"Stay strong"*
- *"We're in this together"*

#### **The Moral Reckoning**

**James Can't Escape Reality:**

He was GOOD MAN who did EVIL THING.

Can't reconcile:
- Loving father who reads bedtime stories
- Devoted professional who clients trust
- Cold-blooded killer who strangled man

**Attempts at Rationalization:**

"He was going to destroy us."  
*(But murder is murder.)*

"We had no choice."  
*(There are ALWAYS choices.)*

"He was cruel to Helena."  
*(Doesn't justify taking life.)*

"I did it for love."  
*(Love doesn't excuse evil.)*

**The Truth James Knows:**

He became what he feared. He's the monster now.

And worst part? He'd do it again.

Because losing Helena is worse than damnation.

## RELATIONSHIPS

### 🎭 RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL CHARACTERS

*(10 characters mapped with interaction dynamics)*

---

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD III** *(Victim/Blackmailer)*

**Official Connection:** Business client, investment manager relationship

**Secret Reality:** Murder victim, blackmailer, destroyer of James's life

**James's True Feelings:**
- **Hatred:** Reggie was going to send him to prison
- **Fear:** Had power to destroy everything (and used it)
- **Guilt:** Murdered him (can never undo)
- **Relief:** Dead = immediate threat gone

**Dynamic Before Murder:**

**Professional (Public):**
REGGIE: "James, how are my railroad investments performing?"
JAMES: "Quite well, Mr. Ashford. Up 8% this quarter."
REGGIE: "Excellent. Keep up the good work."

**Blackmail (Private, post-discovery):**
REGGIE: "Enjoy Christmas with your children, James. It's the last one you'll have as a free man."
JAMES: [Seething but controlled] "You're a cruel man."
REGGIE: "I'm a just man. You're a thief."

**During Murder:**
All calculation vanished. Pure desperate violence.

**After Murder:**
James can't look at body without feeling:
- Horror (what have I done?)
- Relief (threat eliminated)
- Guilt (I'm murderer)
- Fear (will I be caught?)

---

### 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Co-Conspirator/Lover)*

**Official Connection:** Client's wife, social acquaintance

**Secret Reality:** Lover (1 year), co-murderer, reason for everything

**James's Feelings:**
- **Love:** Deep, desperate, all-consuming
- **Loyalty:** Would die for her (proved it by killing for her)
- **Dependency:** She's his oxygen, reason to exist
- **Guilt:** Destroyed her life too (not just saved it)

**Dynamic Examples:**

**Public (Cold Politeness):**
JAMES: "Mrs. Ashford, my condolences on your loss."
HELENA: "Thank you, Mr. Harrods. You're most kind."
[No eye contact beyond polite glance—too dangerous]

**Private (Stolen Moments):**
HELENA: [Whispered, hallway] "I can't stop shaking."
JAMES: [Brief hand squeeze] "Breathe. I'm here."
HELENA: "What if they know?"
JAMES: "They don't. We're careful."

**During Crisis:**
[When evidence mounts, late game]
HELENA: [Terrified] "They're going to figure it out."
JAMES: [Calm, protective] "If they do... I'll take full blame. Say I forced you."
HELENA: "No! We're in this together—"
JAMES: "Your children don't deserve to lose their mother. Mine already lost their father the moment I did this."

**The Tragedy:**

Their love is REAL. Beautiful even.

But born from desperation, sustained by murder, doomed by guilt.

---

### 🟡 **EMILIA HARRODS** *(Wife/Innocent Victim)*

**Connection:** Married 8 years, mother of his children

**James's Feelings:**
- **Guilt:** Overwhelming (betrayed her utterly)
- **Affection:** Genuine (doesn't love romantically but CARES deeply)
- **Pity:** She deserves better (always did)
- **Dread:** She'll learn truth eventually (will destroy her)

**The Marriage:**

**How It Started (1918):**
- War just ended (James returned from service)
- Emilia: kind, beautiful, good Catholic girl
- Family approved ("Perfect match!")
- James: thought "This is what life is supposed to be"

**The Slow Fade (1920-1925):**
- Not BAD marriage (no fighting, no cruelty)
- Just... empty (roommates who co-parent)
- Emilia loved him (still does)
- James: affectionate but not IN love

**Current State (1926):**
- Emilia: still devoted, trusting, unaware
- James: caring but distant, massive secrets
- Children: only real connection left
- Marriage: corpse animated by duty

**Interaction Examples:**

**At Party (Dutiful Husband):**
EMILIA: "James, darling, shall I bring you another drink?"
JAMES: "No thank you, dear. I'm fine."
EMILIA: [Touches his arm] "You seem tense. Work troubles?"
JAMES: "Just the usual. Nothing to worry about."
[Kisses her forehead—genuine affection, hollow love]

**During Investigation (Protective):**
EMILIA: [Seeing body] "Oh God, James, what happened?!"
JAMES: [Shields her] "Don't look. Please, take the children upstairs."
EMILIA: "But—"
JAMES: "Please. They shouldn't see this."
[Guides her away—protecting her from HIS crime]

**When She Suspects Affair (Act III/IV):**
EMILIA: "James... are you... is there someone else?"
JAMES: [Pause—can't lie well to her] "Emilia..."
EMILIA: [Tears forming] "Just tell me. Please."
JAMES: [Quiet] "I'm so sorry."
EMILIA: [World shattering] "How long?"
JAMES: "It doesn't matter. I never wanted to hurt you."
EMILIA: "But you did. You are."

**Her Suicide (Act IV):**

When Emilia learns FULL truth (affair + murder), she drowns herself.

James's reaction: **Complete breakdown.**

Not just grief. GUILT beyond measure.

He didn't just kill Reggie. He killed HIS WIFE too.

---

### 🟢 **FILIPP MORETTI** *(Business Partner/Unwitting Accomplice)*

**Connection:** Speakeasy investment partner, wire supplier

**James's Feelings:**
- **Guilt:** Used Filipp (acquired murder weapon via lie)
- **Respect:** Good man, honest businessman
- **Fear:** If Filipp realizes wire's true purpose...

**The Investment:**

**September 1926:**
JAMES: "Filipp, I have capital to invest. Your speakeasy operation interests me."
FILIPP: "$8,000 investment, you become silent partner. Fair?"
JAMES: "Very fair."

**The Wire Request:**

**December 21, 1926:**
JAMES: "I need a favor. Piano wire. High quality."
FILIPP: "What for?"
JAMES: "Gift for jazz musicians. Custom instrument project."
FILIPP: [Accepting explanation] "I can get that for you."

**After Murder:**

If Filipp discovers HE provided the weapon:

FILIPP: [Horrified] "The wire I gave you... you used it to..."
JAMES: "Filipp, I'm sorry. I lied."
FILIPP: "You made me ACCOMPLICE! I gave you murder weapon!"
JAMES: "You didn't know. You're innocent."
FILIPP: "My HANDS gave you death! How am I innocent?!"

**James's Internal Guilt:**

Dragged good man into murder conspiracy unknowingly.

Filipp will carry this forever: "I helped kill someone."

---

### 🟡 **JOÃO CARLOS MENDES (JC)** *(Detective/Investigator)*

**Connection:** Hired investigator, will unravel murder

**James's Feelings:**
- **Fear:** Professional detective (trained to see lies)
- **Respect:** Competent, intelligent, thorough
- **Strategy:** Must appear cooperative while hiding everything

**Interaction Dynamic:**

**Initial (Helpful Citizen):**
JC: "Mr. Harrods, I'll need to speak with everyone. Your account of this evening?"
JAMES: "Of course, Detective. Happy to help however I can."

**Interrogation (Act II/III):**

JC: "Where were you between 20h10 and 20h18?"
JAMES: "In the ballroom, primarily. Daisy was performing. Beautiful voice."
JC: "Anyone can confirm?"
JAMES: "Several people. My wife, for one."
JC: "And your relationship with Mr. Ashford?"
JAMES: "Professional. I managed some of his investments."
JC: "Only professional?"
JAMES: [Careful] "We weren't friends, if that's what you're asking. Business associates."

**When Pressed About Fraud:**

JC: "I've discovered financial discrepancies in your accounts."
JAMES: [Freezes—PANIC] "I... there must be some mistake."
JC: "Fifteen thousand dollars, Mr. Harrods. From Mrs. Whitmore's portfolio."
JAMES: [Caught] "That's... that's a private matter."
JC: "Private? Or criminal?"
JAMES: [Quiet] "I intended to replace it."
JC: "With what? And did Mr. Ashford know about this?"
JAMES: [Silence = answer]

**When Cornered (Act V):**

JC: "The wire came from Filipp. You acquired it. You had motive. You had opportunity."
JAMES: [Long pause] "And if I confess?"
JC: "Then you tell me truth. All of it."
JAMES: [Looks at Helena across room—she nods]
[Turns back to JC]
"We did it. Together. Helena and I. We killed him."

**Interaction Tips:**
- NEVER volunteer information
- Answer only what's asked (precisely, no more)
- Use business language (retreat to professional mode)
- When caught: dignity in confession (no theatrics)

---

### 🟡 **PADRE RUI SANTOS** *(Confessor/Moral Authority)*

**Connection:** Knows murder plan (confessional seal), religious conscience

**James's Feelings:**
- **Guilt:** Burdened holy man with terrible secret
- **Need:** Desperately wants absolution (can't have it)
- **Fear:** Padre knows EVERYTHING (but can't tell)

**The Confession (December 20, 1926):**

JAMES: "Forgive me, Father, for I am about to sin."
PADRE: "My son, confession is for sins committed, not—"
JAMES: "I'm planning to murder someone. Reginald Ashford."
PADRE: [Shocked silence]
JAMES: "I know it's evil. I know I'll damn myself. But I see no other way."
PADRE: "There is ALWAYS another way, my son. Always."
JAMES: "Prison? Destroying my children's lives? The woman I love suffering forever under a tyrant? Those are the alternatives."
PADRE: "Murder is mortal sin. It separates you from God's grace—"
JAMES: "Then I'll be separated. I accept that. I just... I needed someone to KNOW. Before I do this unforgivable thing."

**At Party (Post-Murder):**

They see each other. Both know.

PADRE: [Quietly, private moment] "You did it."
JAMES: [Not denying] "Yes."
PADRE: "And now you must live with it."
JAMES: "I know."
PADRE: "Your soul—"
JAMES: "Is already lost, Father. But thank you for trying."

**Potential Late-Game Scene:**

JAMES: [Breaking down] "I need absolution."
PADRE: "You know I cannot give that without true repentance."
JAMES: "I can't repent. I'd do it again. Does that damn me absolutely?"
PADRE: [Sad] "Only God judges ultimately. But yes... unrepentant murder..."
JAMES: "Then I'm bound for hell. At least I'll have chosen my path consciously."

---

### 🟡 **MARIA FLETCHER** *(Journalist/Observer)*

**Connection:** Professional writer, potentially dangerous observer

**James's Perspective:**
- **Wariness:** Writers notice EVERYTHING (dangerous)
- **Professionalism:** Courteous but distant
- **Strategy:** Reveal nothing, appear boring

**Minimal Interaction:**

MARIA: "Mr. Harrods, you must be shocked by this tragedy."
JAMES: "Of course. Deeply disturbing."
MARIA: [Taking notes] "You were Mr. Ashford's banker?"
JAMES: "Investment manager, yes."
MARIA: "Must have known him well."
JAMES: "Professionally. Not personally."
MARIA: "Still, such violence. Who could have wanted him dead?"
JAMES: [Careful] "I couldn't possibly speculate."

**If She Digs:**

MARIA: "I've heard rumors... financial irregularities?"
JAMES: [Tense] "Rumors are rarely accurate, Miss Fletcher."
MARIA: "But sometimes they are."
JAMES: "I make it a policy not to discuss clients' finances."
MARIA: "Even dead clients?"
JAMES: "Especially then. They can't defend themselves against speculation."

---

### 🟡 **DAISY VALMONT** *(Singer/Red Herring)*

**Connection:** Hired entertainment, fellow red herring suspect

**James's Perspective:**
- **Indifferent:** Cabaret singer (not his world)
- **Useful:** Her drama draws attention (away from him)
- **Pity:** If she's actually innocent (probably is)

**Minimal Interaction:**

JAMES: "Miss Valmont, lovely performance."
DAISY: "Merci, monsieur! You are too kind!"
JAMES: "Your voice is quite remarkable."
DAISY: "A banker who appreciates art! How refreshing!"

**If Both Suspected:**

DAISY: [To James] "They think we're the obvious ones, non?"
JAMES: "I beg your pardon?"
DAISY: "Scorned lover..." [gestures to self] "...and, what, jealous banker?"
JAMES: "I assure you, I had no reason to—"
DAISY: "Relax, chéri. I know you didn't do it. You're too... composed."
JAMES: [Carefully] "And you?"
DAISY: "I was SINGING, darling. Can't murder AND perform simultaneously."

---

### 🟡 **INÊS & DENISE BEAUMONT** *(The Twins/Red Herrings)*

**Connection:** Reggie's secret daughters, strong suspects

**James's Perspective:**
- **Sympathy:** Reggie wronged them terribly
- **Relief:** They draw suspicion (away from him)
- **Curiosity:** Did they actually do it? (Would be justice)

**If They're Accused:**

JAMES: [To group] "They certainly had motive. Abandonment is powerful."
INÊS: "We didn't kill him!"
JAMES: "I'm not accusing. Simply stating that pain like yours... can drive people to extremes."
DENISE: "You think we're monsters?"
JAMES: [Quiet] "I think we're all capable of terrible things when desperate."

**If James Is Revealed as Killer:**

DENISE: "Wait. HIM? The banker?!"
JAMES: "I'm sorry you didn't get justice directly."
INÊS: "You took that from us."
JAMES: "He wronged you. He wronged all of us. Perhaps... that's the only honest thing I can say."

---

### 🟡 **RICARDO/CLARENCE** *(Victim/Butler)*

**Connection:** Initially plays Reggie (victim), then butler (witness)

**James's Interaction:**

**With "Reggie" (Before Murder):**
Performed normally—professional, polite.

**After "Reggie" Becomes Clarence:**
Minimal interaction (butler = background)

**If Clarence Gives Damning Testimony:**

CLARENCE: "I saw Mr. Harrods near the office hallway. Waiting. 20h08."
JAMES: [Careful] "I was... checking on business papers. Nothing unusual."
CLARENCE: "And Mrs. Ashford? She entered office at 20h09."
JAMES: "I wouldn't know. I returned to ballroom."
CLARENCE: [Steady gaze] "Did you, sir?"

---

## GOALS & STATUS

### 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

#### **PRIMARY GOAL: Survive Undetected**

**What This Means:**

1. **Maintain Innocence** (Appear shocked, helpful, cooperative)
2. **Protect Helena** (She's co-conspirator but must appear victim too)
3. **Control Information** (What gets discovered, when, by whom)
4. **Establish Alibis** (Account for time, movements, whereabouts)

**Success Criteria:**
- NOT arrested/accused by end of night
- Helena safe too (both survive or both fall)
- Evidence doesn't conclusively point to you
- Other suspects look more guilty

**Methods:**

**Behavioral Control:**
- Stay calm (ALWAYS—bankers don't panic)
- Be helpful (good citizen aiding investigation)
- Show appropriate emotion (shocked, not guilty)
- Never contradict Helena's story

**Information Management:**
- Admit ONLY what's provable
- Deny affair as long as possible (scandal but not murder)
- Explain fraud as "complicated" (not motive for murder)
- Point to other suspects subtly (not obviously)

**Alliance Protection:**
- Brief coordinating moments with Helena (careful, private)
- Never show affection publicly (not even glances if avoidable)
- If one accused: Other tries to deflect (without being obvious)
- Final resort: James takes full blame (protects Helena)

#### **SECONDARY GOAL: Manage Emilia**

**The Problem:**
- Wife is INNOCENT, PRESENT, TRUSTING
- Will eventually learn about affair (devastating)
- Might learn about murder (suicide trigger)

**Your Strategy:**

**Phase 1 (Early Game): Maintain Normalcy**
- Dutiful husband behavior
- Protective (shield from horror)
- Affectionate (but hollow)

**Phase 2 (When Affair Surfaces): Damage Control**
- Admit affair IF evidence appears
- Frame as "mistake," "weakness," "sorry"
- NEVER admit murder (protect her from that knowledge)

**Phase 3 (If Murder Revealed): Try to Save Her**
- "I did it alone" (lie to protect)
- "She knew nothing" (true)
- "Please, let her take the children and go"

**Tragic Reality:**
Can't save her. When she learns full truth, she'll break.

#### **TERTIARY GOAL: Protect Your Children**

**Tomás (6) and Maria (4):**

They're upstairs. Asleep. Innocent.

**Your Driving Fear:**
They'll grow up knowing: "Daddy murdered someone."

**Desperate Hope:**
Maybe... somehow... they never know?

**If Caught:**

JAMES: [To JC] "My children. Please. They're upstairs. Can someone... take them away before you arrest me? They shouldn't see their father in handcuffs."

JC: "That can be arranged."

JAMES: "Thank you. That's... that's all I ask."

#### **HIDDEN GOAL: Emotional Survival**

**What You're REALLY Doing:**

- Processing unprocessable (I killed someone)
- Maintaining sanity (guilt eating alive)
- Holding Helena together (she's breaking too)
- Saying goodbye to life (prison or death ahead)

**Inner Question:**

*"Was it worth it? Trading my soul for a chance at love? Would I do it again?"*

**Answer:**

*"Yes. God help me, yes. Because losing her was worse than damnation."*

---

### ✅ YOUR STATUS: GUILTY

**You DID Murder Reginald Ashford III.**

#### **The Truth**

**WHO:** You and Helena (co-conspirators, equal guilt)

**WHAT:** Strangled Reggie with piano wire

**WHEN:** December 24, 1926, 20h11-20h11:40

**WHERE:** Office (then moved to punch bowl)

**WHY:** 
- He discovered your fraud (prison threat)
- He discovered your affair (ruin threat)
- You were desperate (no other option visible)
- You loved Helena (desperate, all-consuming love)

**HOW:**
- Planned December 20-23
- Acquired wire from Filipp (December 21)
- Helena lured Reggie to office (20h09)
- You strangled from behind (40 seconds)
- Staged body in punch bowl (20h15-20h16)
- Both returned separately, pretended shock

#### **Your Guilt is Absolute**

**Legally:**
- First-degree murder (premeditated, planned)
- Conspiracy to commit murder (plotted with Helena)
- Fraud & embezzlement (separate crimes)

**Morally:**
- Took a human life (unforgivable)
- Destroyed your wife (betrayal + suicide)
- Orphaned your children (they lose both parents)
- Corrupted holy man (Padre forced to keep secret)
- Betrayed trust (clients, friends, society)

**Spiritually:**
- Mortal sin (Catholic doctrine: hell-bound)
- Unrepentant (would do it again = no salvation)
- Confessed beforehand (knew it was evil, did it anyway)

#### **But You're Also Sympathetic**

**Because:**

- Loved deeply (Helena is real, not excuse but context)
- Feared justly (prison was real threat)
- Saw no other way (tunnel vision of desperation)
- Not naturally evil (good man who broke)
- Genuine remorse (hollow victory, guilt consumes)

**This Makes You:**

**Tragic Villain, Not Monster**

Greek tragedy protagonist: fatal flaw (desperate love) leads to inevitable doom.

#### **Playing This Duality**

**Early Game:** Innocent mask (perfect performance)

**Mid Game:** Cracks showing (stress bleeds through)

**Late Game:** Relief at confession (exhausted from lying)

**Final Moment:** Dignity in acceptance (I did this. I'll face consequences.)

---

## HOW TO PLAY

### 🎭 COMPLETE PERFORMANCE GUIDE

---

### PART 1: CORE PERFORMANCE ELEMENTS

#### **THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE**

**You Must:**
- APPEAR completely innocent (early acts)
- HIDE massive guilt (constant internal management)
- SHOW subtle tells (for observant players to notice)
- CONFESS believably (when caught, authentic breakdown)

**The Balance:**

Too obvious = caught immediately = game over too fast

Too perfect = no one suspects = no tension = boring

**Goal:** Guilty person TRYING to look innocent (not quite succeeding)

#### **VOICE & SPEECH**

**Speaking Voice:**
- Moderate pitch, calm tone (banker's reassurance)
- Controlled volume (never shouts, even under stress)
- Clear diction (educated, precise)

**Speech Patterns:**

**Normal (Early Game):**
"In my professional opinion, we should notify the authorities immediately."

**Stressed (Mid Game):**
"I... yes. The authorities. That would be... prudent."

**Breaking (Late Game):**
"Just... please. Ask what you need to ask. I'm so tired."

**When Lying (Key Tells):**
- Over-explains (too much detail = suspicious)
- More formal language (retreat to professional armor)
- Pauses longer (calculating story)
- Touches wedding ring (guilt tell)

**When Truthful (Rare):**
- Simpler words (drops jargon)
- Direct answers (no hedging)
- Quieter voice (vulnerable)
- Eye contact (not avoiding)

#### **PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE**

**Posture:**
- Upright, controlled (military bearing)
- Shoulders back (projecting confidence)
- Minimal slouching (even when exhausted)

**Key Physical Tells:**

1. **Wedding Ring Twisting** (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - **When:** Guilty thoughts, lying about affair, thinking of Emilia
   - **How:** Right hand unconsciously twists ring on left
   - **Frequency:** Increases with stress
   - **Allow:** Other players to NOTICE (some will catch it)

2. **Pocket Watch Checking**
   - **When:** Needs control, buying time to think
   - **How:** Pulls watch, checks time (even when irrelevant)
   - **Purpose:** Grounding ritual (familiar object = safety)

3. **Throat Clearing**
   - **When:** About to lie or deflect
   - **How:** Small "ahem" before speaking
   - **Purpose:** Buys seconds to formulate response

4. **Stillness**
   - **When:** Very stressed (freeze response)
   - **How:** Body goes completely still, focused
   - **Contrast:** Normally measured; stressed = statue-like

5. **Micro-Expressions** (Advanced)
   - **Fear:** Brief flash when evidence appears
   - **Relief:** When someone else accused
   - **Guilt:** When looking at Emilia
   - **Love:** When glancing at Helena (try to suppress)

**Movement Style:**
- Economical gestures (no wasted energy)
- Controlled pace (deliberate, not rushed)
- Professional distance (doesn't crowd people)

### PART 2: SCENE-BY-SCENE PERFORMANCE

#### **ACT I: COCKTAIL HOUR (19h45-20h00)**

**YOUR ENTRANCE**

**Goal:** Blend in. Be boring. Be forgettable.

**Arrival:**
[Enters with Emilia, children staying home with caretaker]

"Good evening, everyone. Reggie, Helena, thank you for having us."

[Handshakes, polite smiles]

**Internal State:**
- Terrified (murder in 30 minutes)
- Hyperaware (every detail noticed)
- Dissociated (watching self from outside)
- Controlled (CANNOT show this)

**Key Interactions:**

**With Reggie (Forced):**

REGGIE: "James! How are the markets treating you?"

JAMES: [Professional smile] "Quite well, thank you. Your portfolio is performing admirably."

REGGIE: [Knowing look] "Is it though? We should discuss those... discrepancies."

JAMES: [Stomach drops—maintains smile] "Of course. After the holiday perhaps?"

REGGIE: [Cruel smile] "Oh yes. After the holiday. We'll have ALL the time in the world to discuss your... creative accounting."

[Walks away]

JAMES: [Alone, hand trembles slightly—composes self]

**With Helena (Careful):**

[Cannot interact directly—too dangerous]

[Across room, brief eye contact]

MESSAGE: *"Soon. Stay strong."*

[She nods imperceptibly]

**With Emilia (Dutiful Husband):**

EMILIA: "Darling, shall I bring you a drink?"

JAMES: "No, thank you, dear. I'm fine."

EMILIA: [Concerned] "You seem tense. Is work bothering you?"

JAMES: [Forces warmer smile] "Holiday stress. You know how it is."

[Kisses her forehead—guilt stabbing him]

**20h00-20h08: Final Minutes Before**

**Position Yourself:**
- Near office hallway (must be in position)
- Casual (chatting with people, drink in hand)
- Checking watch frequently ("busy man" cover)

**Internal Countdown:**

*"Nine minutes. Eight minutes. Seven..."*

*"This is real. This is happening. No turning back now."*

*"Helena across room. Beautiful. This is for her. For us."*

*"Emilia laughing with someone. God forgive me."*

*"Children at home. Asleep. Innocent. I'm doing this for them too. Aren't I?"*

*"Six minutes. Five..."*

**20h08: The Move**

Quietly excuse yourself:

"Pardon me, I need to check on something in my briefcase."

[Walk toward office hallway—calm, purposeful]

[Glance back—Emilia chatting, not watching]

[Enter hallway—alone—breathe]

**20h09: Hiding Position**

Office door. Helena arrives with Reggie:

HELENA: "Darling, I have a surprise for you!"

REGGIE: [Entering] "What's this about—"

[James behind door. Wire ready.]

[This is it. Point of no return.]

---

**20h11-20h11:40: THE MURDER** *(Covered in Secret #3)*

---

**20h18: THE "DISCOVERY"**

**Helena's Scream:** *"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!!"*

**Your Performance:**

[In hallway, just "returning" from supposed errand]

[Hears scream—run toward ballroom]

"What happened?! What's going on?!"

[Enters—sees crowd around punch bowl]

[Pushes through—sees body]

**REACTION** (CRITICAL MOMENT):

[Freeze—stare]

**Visual Tells:**
- Eyes widen (genuine shock at seeing it REAL)
- Face pales (horror at what you've done)
- Hand to mouth (suppressing reaction)
- Step backward (recoil)

"My God. What... what happened to him?"

**Internal Reality:**

*"I did that. That's my work. He's DEAD. I killed him."*

*"He looks... God, his face. The star. We did that."*

*"Don't vomit. Don't cry. Don't confess. Be professional."*

[Takes breath—banker mode activates]

"Everyone, please step back. This is a crime scene. We should notify the police immediately."

[Looks around—sees JC if present]

"Detective Mendes, I believe this falls under your expertise?"

[Controlled, helpful, PERFORMING competence]

---

#### **ACT II: INVESTIGATION BEGINS (20h18-21h00)**

**YOUR STRATEGY**

**Goals:**
1. Establish alibi (where you were 20h10-20h18)
2. Appear helpful (cooperative witness)
3. Avoid Helena (no interaction = no suspicion)
4. Manage Emilia (she's shaken, needs comfort)

**Your Fabricated Timeline:**

- 20h00-20h08: Cocktail hour (TRUE)
- 20h08-20h14: "Checking briefcase in car" (LIE—actually murdering)
- 20h14-20h17: "Returning to ballroom" (LIE—actually staging body)
- 20h17-20h18: "Listening to Daisy's song" (PARTIAL TRUTH)

**Problem:** Weak alibi (no witnesses for 10 minutes)

**When Questioned:**

JC: "Mr. Harrods, where were you between 20h10 and 20h18?"

JAMES: "I stepped out briefly. My briefcase—I'd left some documents in my car. Needed to retrieve them."

JC: "Which car?"

JAMES: "The black Packard. Street parking, two blocks north."

JC: "Anyone see you?"

JAMES: [Pause—careful] "I don't believe so. It was only a few minutes."

JC: "Quite a few minutes. Nearly eight."

JAMES: "I... also needed some air. The party was quite crowded."

JC: [Notes this—suspicious but not proof]

**Managing Tells:**

During this exchange:
- Twist ring (twice)
- Clear throat (before lying about car)
- Check pocket watch (when uncomfortable)
- Maintain eye contact (forcing it—bankers don't avoid gaze)

**Interaction with Emilia:**

EMILIA: [Grabs his arm] "James, I'm frightened. Who would do this?"

JAMES: [Protective] "I don't know, darling. But you're safe. I'm here."

EMILIA: "Should we take the children and leave?"

JAMES: "The police will want to speak with everyone. But they're safe at home."

[Holds her—internal screaming]

*"You don't know you're hugging a murderer. God, Emilia, I'm so sorry."*

**Avoiding Helena:**

[She's across room, being comforted as widow]

[You want to go to her—CAN'T]

[Brief eye contact—she's terrified]

[You nod slightly: *"Stay strong. Don't break."*]

[Look away—too dangerous]

---

#### **ACT III: EVIDENCE EMERGES (21h00-21h30)**

**THE PRESSURE MOUNTS**

**Evidence Being Discovered:**
1. Piano wire (murder weapon found behind piano)
2. Your fraud (accountant records surface)
3. Affair rumors (whispers start)

**Reaction to Piano Wire:**

JC: [Shows wire in bag] "Anyone recognize this?"

JAMES: [Looks—KNOWS IT INTIMATELY—must pretend ignorance]

"Appears to be... piano wire? For musical instruments?"

JC: "Found behind the piano. Used for strangulation."

JAMES: [Controlled horror] "Good God. Strangled? I thought he drowned."

JC: "Staged to look like drowning. This was murder, Mr. Harrods. Premeditated."

JAMES: [Processing—performing calculation] "Then... someone planned this. Brought a weapon."

JC: "Someone who knew Mr. Ashford would be in that office. Someone with motive."

[Looks at James pointedly]

JAMES: [Realizes he's suspect—stays calm] "I see."

**When Fraud Is Mentioned:**

MARIA FLETCHER: "Mr. Harrods, I've heard rumors of financial irregularities..."

JAMES: [Tense but professional] "I don't discuss clients' private financial matters, Miss Fletcher."

MARIA: "Even when that client has been murdered?"

JAMES: "Especially then. Respect for the dead."

MARIA: "Or protection for the living?"

[Pointed look]

JAMES: [Cold] "I think we're done here."

**JC Confronts About Fraud:**

JC: [Private conversation] "I know about Mrs. Whitmore's missing $15,000."

JAMES: [Pause—caught—decides honesty is only option]

"Yes. I... made a serious error in judgment."

JC: "Embezzlement is more than error, Mr. Harrods."

JAMES: "I know. I was trying to correct it. The investment went badly."

JC: "And Mr. Ashford knew about this?"

JAMES: [Careful] "Yes. He'd discovered it recently."

JC: "And was he planning to report you?"

JAMES: [Quiet] "Yes. December 26th. After Christmas."

JC: "Quite a motive for murder."

JAMES: [Meets eyes] "Yes. It would be. If I'd done it."

JC: "Did you?"

JAMES: [Long pause—everything in this moment]

"No. I didn't."

[LIE—but delivered with every ounce of sincerity]

---

#### **ACT IV: THE AFFAIR REVEALED (21h30-22h00)**

**THE WORST MOMENT**

**How Affair Gets Revealed:**

Option A: Witness saw you together
Option B: Love letters found
Option C: Someone suspected, speaks up

**When It Comes Out:**

SOMEONE: "Mr. Harrods, is it true you were having an affair with Mrs. Ashford?"

[Room goes SILENT]

[All eyes on you]

[Emilia staring—horror dawning]

JAMES: [Panic—must decide: lie or confess?]

**Option 1: Lie**

"That's absurd. Where would you get such an idea?"

[Emilia will see through this—knows him too well]

**Option 2: Partial Truth** (RECOMMENDED)

[Looks at Emilia—sees betrayal in eyes]

[Looks away—can't bear it]

[Quiet]

"Yes. It's true."

[Emilia makes small sound—breaking]

**Emilia's Reaction:**

EMILIA: [Whisper] "James..."

JAMES: [Can't look at her] "I'm sorry."

EMILIA: "How long?"

JAMES: "It doesn't matter—"

EMILIA: "HOW LONG?!"

[Rare shout—she's shattered]

JAMES: [Quiet] "A year."

EMILIA: [Crumples] "A year. An entire year."

[Tears streaming]

"Our CHILDREN. You came home to our children. After being with HER."

JAMES: "Emilia, please—"

EMILIA: "Don't. Don't touch me. Don't come near me."

[Backs away—world ending]

**Public Reaction:**

MARIA: "Well. This certainly establishes motive."

PADRE RUI: [Sad] "Adultery and murder. Entwined as always."

JC: "Mr. Harrods, this changes things significantly."

JAMES: [Defensive] "Having an affair doesn't make me a murderer."

JC: "No. But it makes you a desperate man with everything to lose."

**Helena Across Room:**

[She's frozen—affair exposed means both destroyed]

[You meet eyes—message: *"I'm sorry. I tried."*]

[She's crying—not for Reggie. For lost future.]

---

#### **ACT V: CONFESSION & CONSEQUENCES (22h00-22h30)**

**WHEN YOU'RE CORNERED**

**The Evidence Mounts:**
- Piano wire traced to Filipp (your request)
- No alibi for murder window
- Motive established (fraud + affair)
- Opportunity clear (knew house layout)

**JC's Final Push:**

JC: "Let's lay this out clearly.

You were embezzling. Reggie was going to expose you. Prison awaited.

You were having affair with Helena. Reggie was going to expose that too. Career destruction.

You acquired piano wire from Filipp. December 21st. Three days before murder.

You have no alibi for the murder window.

You had every reason to want Reginald Ashford dead."

[Pause]

"Did you kill him, Mr. Harrods?"

**Your Choice:**

**Option A: Continue Lying** (Unsustainable)

"No. I understand how it looks, but no."

**Option B: Confess** (Inevitable)

[Long pause]

[Looks at Helena—she nods: *It's over. Tell truth.*]

[Looks at Emilia—she's destroyed already]

[Looks at hands—murderer's hands]

[Deep breath]

"Yes."

[Room reacts—gasps, exclamations]

"Yes. I killed him."

**FULL CONFESSION** (Your Moment)

JC: "Tell us everything."

JAMES: [Sits—exhausted]

"Helena and I... we fell in love. Genuinely. Not an excuse, just... context.

Reggie discovered my fraud. Threatened prison. Ten years. My children would grow up with father in jail.

He discovered our affair. Threatened exposure. My career would be destroyed.

He was going to ruin both of us. December 26th. After Christmas. Gave me 'one last holiday with my family.' How generous."

[Bitter]

"I confessed to Father Juan Carlos. December 20th. Told him I was planning murder. He tried to stop me. I didn't listen.

December 21st, I got the wire from Filipp. Lied. Said it was for musicians.

December 20th through 23rd, Helena and I planned it. How to lure him. How to kill him. How to stage it.

We didn't want to become murderers. We just... couldn't see another way. Desperation makes monsters."

[Pause]

"December 24th. Tonight. 20h09, Helena led him to office. 'Surprise for you,' she said.

I was hidden. Waited.

20h11. We attacked. Piano wire. Both of us. Together.

He struggled. Forty seconds. Longest forty seconds of my life.

Then... he stopped. Dead.

We panicked. Almost ran. Almost confessed right then.

But survival instinct... we staged it. Punch bowl. Star. Tried to create confusion.

Daisy was singing. 'My Funny Valentine.' Beautiful song. Strange soundtrack for moving a body."

[Looks up]

"Then Helena screamed. We pretended shock. And I've been pretending ever since."

[Quiet]

"That's the truth. All of it."

**Aftermath:**

**EMILIA:** [Destroyed] "You... you KILLED someone. You're a MURDERER."

JAMES: "I know."

EMILIA: "And you held our children. With those hands. With killer's hands."

JAMES: [Breaking] "I'm so sorry."

EMILIA: "Sorry? SORRY?!"

[Stands—walks away—can't look at him]

**HELENA:** [Across room] "I'm sorry. This is my fault too—"

EMILIA: [To Helena] "Don't. Just... don't."

[Emilia exits—runs from room]

**JAMES TO JC:**

"She's innocent. Emilia. Completely. She knew nothing."

JC: "I believe you."

JAMES: "And my children... can someone... bring them somewhere safe? Before you arrest me? I don't want them to see..."

JC: "We'll arrange that."

JAMES: "Thank you."

[Pause]

"And Helena... she was desperate too. I'm not excusing her. Or me. But... she wasn't evil. Neither was I. We just... became that way."

**PADRE RUI:** [Approaches]

"Do you repent, my son?"

JAMES: [Honest] "No, Father. I'd do it again. Does that damn me absolutely?"

PADRE: [Sad] "Only God judges. But... yes. Probably."

JAMES: "Then I'm damned. At least I'll have chosen my path honestly."

**FINAL MOMENT:**

[Police arrive—handcuffs]

[James stands—dignity in acceptance]

[Looks one last time at Helena: *"I love you. I'm sorry."*]

[She mouths back: *"I love you. Always."*]

[Led away—life over—but dies for love]

## BACK COVER

### 💔 CLOSING REFLECTION

**The Tragedy of James Harrods**

He didn't want to be a villain.

He wanted to be a good man.

For thirty-nine years, he WAS a good man:
- Loving father
- Dutiful husband
- Trusted banker
- Respected professional

Then he made a mistake. (The embezzlement.)

Then he fell in love. (Helena.)

Then he faced impossible choice. (Prison or freedom?)

And in that moment, the good man died.

The murderer was born.

Not because he was evil.

But because he was desperate.

Because desperate love is more dangerous than hatred.

Because humans, when cornered, become animals.

And animals, when protecting what they love, become monsters.

James Harrods murdered Reginald Ashford.

But desperation murdered James Harrods first.

All that walked out of that office was a hollow shell wearing a banker's suit.

Pretending to be human.

Waiting for judgment.

### 💎 CHARACTER PHILOSOPHY

> *"I wasn't born a monster.  
> Love made me one.  
> Fear completed the transformation."*

> *"Every day I looked at my children.  
> And thought: 'I'm doing this for you.'  
> Then I did it.  
> And realized: I've destroyed us all."*

> *"She was worth it.  
> Helena.  
> Worth my soul.  
> Worth damnation.  
> Worth everything.  
> ...Wasn't she?"*

---

### 🎭 FINAL NOTE TO PLAYER

**TIAGO:**

James is the hardest role in this game.

Not because he's the killer (that's Helena's emotional weight).

But because he must HIDE being killer.

Every conversation is a minefield.

Every question is a trap.

Every moment is performance.

And beneath it all:

The grief of what he's become.

The love that drove him to murder.

The guilt that will consume him forever.

Play him not as villain.

Not as victim.

But as HUMAN.

Flawed. Desperate. Broken.

Who made the worst choice possible.

For the best reason he knew.

And must now live with consequences.

**That's tragedy.**

**That's James.**
