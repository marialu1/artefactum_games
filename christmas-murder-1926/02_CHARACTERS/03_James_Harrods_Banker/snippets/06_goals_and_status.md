# GOALS & STATUS

## YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

### GOAL #1: APPEAR INNOCENT
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**What This Means:**
- Hide all guilt (crushing weight inside)
- React naturally to murder discovery
- Express appropriate shock/horror
- Maintain controlled demeanor

**How:**
- Controlled body language
- Careful word choices
- Minimal emotion display
- Professional facade

### GOAL #2: PROTECT HELENA
**Priority:** HIGH

**What This Means:**
- Don't incriminate her
- Support her "grief" performance
- Coordinate alibis subtly
- Never reveal affair unless forced

**How:**
- Don't look at her too much
- Don't defend her too strongly (suspicious)
- Let her handle her own interrogation
- Trust the plan

### GOAL #3: MAINTAIN ALIBI
**Priority:** HIGH

**What This Means:**
- Weak alibi: "I was mingling"
- Stick to story consistently
- Account for your movements
- Explain any gaps carefully

**Your Timeline:**
- 20h00-20h08: Cocktail hour (visible)
- 20h08-20h12: **MURDER** (hidden near office)
- 20h12-20h15: **STAGING** (with Helena)
- 20h15-20h18: Return to party (separate from Helena)
- 20h18+: React with crowd

### GOAL #4: CONFESS WITH DIGNITY
**Priority:** WHEN TIME COMES

**What This Means:**
When evidence is undeniable, confess honestly.

**Why:**
- Honorable man (even now)
- Lying further = cowardice
- Truth = final redemption
- Face consequences like man you were

**How to Confess:**
- Wait for JC's evidence presentation
- Don't drag it out (dignity)
- Tell full truth (no more lies)
- Protect Helena if possible (but truth matters more)
- Accept consequences

## YOUR STATUS: GUILTY

### YOU COMMITTED MURDER

**With:** Helena Ashford (co-killer)

**Victim:** Reginald Ashford III

**Method:** Strangulation with piano wire

**Time:** 20h11 (December 24, 1926)

**Location:** Reggie's office (then staged in ballroom)

### YOUR DILEMMA

You are **NOT** a murderer by nature. You're:
- Honorable man (20 years integrity)
- Desperate man (one mistake spiraled)
- Guilty man (killed to survive)
- Doomed man (can't escape this)

**The Impossible Situation:**
- Option 1: Prison for embezzlement (ruin, disgrace)
- Option 2: Murder to prevent exposure (even worse ruin)
- You chose Option 2
- Now you pay

### WHAT YOU FACE

**If Caught:**
- Murder charge (execution or life imprisonment)
- Fraud charge (separate crime)
- Betrayal of Emilia (she learns everything)
- Loss of everything (career, reputation, freedom)

**If Not Caught (Impossible):**
- Guilt forever (never sleeps again)
- Watching Emilia's trust (knowing you betrayed it)
- Living with Helena's grief (both trapped in horror)

**Reality:**
You WILL be caught. Evidence is too strong. JC is too good.

Your job: Face it with whatever honor remains.

## THE WEIGHT YOU CARRY

Tonight you must:
- Hide crushing guilt
- Appear normal when screaming inside
- Protect Helena (love her despite everything)
- Eventually confess (only way out)

This is the hardest role.

Because you're not playing a villain.

You're playing a good man who did unforgivable things.

And now must face the consequences.

That's James Harrods.

That's you tonight.
