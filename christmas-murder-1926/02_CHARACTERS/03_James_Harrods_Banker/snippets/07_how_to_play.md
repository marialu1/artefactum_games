# HOW TO PLAY

## CORE STRATEGY

**You are:** Guilty killer trying to appear innocent

**Your Challenge:** Hide crushing guilt behind banker's professionalism

**Your Arc:** Controlled facade → Evidence mounts → Honorable confession

---

## KEY PERFORMANCE TIPS

### 1. THE FACADE (Acts I-III)

**Physical Control:**
- Straight posture (military bearing)
- Steady hands (hide tremors)
- Neutral expression (banker mask)
- Minimal movement (controlled, calculated)

**Nervous Tells (Subtle):**
- Adjust cufflinks (when stressed)
- Check watch (deadline anxiety)
- Straighten tie (composure maintenance)

**Voice:**
- Calm, measured tone
- British accent (mild)
- Formal language ("I assure you...")
- Pause before answering (calculating)

### 2. THE GUILT (Internal)

**What You're Hiding:**
- Reggie's face (dying, terrified)
- Helena's tears (shared horror)
- Emilia's trust (betrayed completely)
- Your soul (can you live with this?)

**Physical Manifestations:**
- Stomach churns (don't eat)
- Hands want to shake (control them)
- Want to confess (resist until evidence demands it)

### 3. KEY MOMENTS

**BODY DISCOVERY (20h18):**
- React with crowd (shock, horror)
- Don't overdo it (you're controlled man)
- Support Helena subtly (not too much)
- "This is terrible. Who could have done this?"

**INTERROGATION (Acts II-IV):**

**When JC asks about fraud:**
JAMES: [Pause] "That's... a private banking matter."
JC: "Not when murder's involved."
JAMES: [Longer pause] "Yes. There were... irregularities."

**When JC asks about alibi:**
JAMES: "I was mingling. Speaking with other guests."
JC: "Anyone specifically?"
JAMES: [Hesitation] "Several people. I can't recall exact times."

**When wire is revealed:**
JAMES: [Sees it, freezes for half-second]
"I... yes. I requested that from Mr. Moretti."
"It was a gift. For musicians."
[Knows this sounds weak]

**THE CONFESSION (Act IV - When Evidence Undeniable):**

JC presents: fraud evidence + wire purchase + timeline + motive

JAMES: [Long silence]
[Looks at Helena]
[Looks at Emilia - she's about to learn everything]
[Looks at JC]

"Yes."

[Pause]

"I did it. We did it. Helena and I."

[Then tell full truth - see Private Secrets for complete confession]

### 4. RELATIONSHIP MOMENTS

**With Helena:**
- DON'T look at her too much (suspicious)
- DON'T defend her too strongly (obvious)
- DO support her grief performance (subtly)
- Coordinated glances (brief, meaningful)

**With Emilia:**
- THIS IS TORTURE
- She trusts you completely
- You've betrayed her utterly
- Be kind to her (it's the least you can do)
- When she learns affair: accept her devastation

**With JC:**
- Respect him (he's doing his job)
- Don't lie unnecessarily (caught too easily)
- Answer questions carefully (truth when possible)
- When confessing: look him in eye (dignity)

### 5. ACT-BY-ACT STRATEGY

**ACT I (Before Murder Discovery):**
- Visible, mingling
- Professional banker mode
- Slightly distracted (inner turmoil)
- React naturally to body discovery

**ACT II (Initial Investigation):**
- Maintain facade
- Give basic information
- Weak alibi: "mingling"
- Watch Helena (don't be obvious)

**ACT III (Evidence Mounting):**
- Pressure increases
- Fraud discovered
- Wire traced to you
- Timeline gaps exposed
- Stay controlled (harder now)

**ACT IV (Confrontation):**
- JC presents full case
- Evidence undeniable
- Look at Helena (time?)
- Confess with dignity

**ACT V (Aftermath):**
- Full truth told
- Accept consequences
- Emilia's devastation (watch it happen)
- Face arrest/punishment

## REMEMBER

✅ You're not a villain - you're a desperate man who made terrible choices

✅ Control is everything - the moment you break, game changes

✅ Confession is inevitable - do it with honor when time comes

✅ This is tragedy - play it with weight it deserves

---

## SIGNATURE LINES

When maintaining facade:
- "I assure you, I had nothing to do with this."
- "That's quite impossible."
- "I must protest this line of questioning."

When guilt shows (subtle):
- [Adjusts cufflinks] "I... need a moment."
- [Checks watch] "Time is rather pressing."

When confessing:
- "Yes. We did it. I won't lie anymore."
- "I'm sorry. For everything. But sorry doesn't undo murder."
- "I'll accept whatever consequences come."
