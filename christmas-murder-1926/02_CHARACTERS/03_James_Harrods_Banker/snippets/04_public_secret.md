# PUBLIC SECRET

## WHAT YOU CAN SHARE FREELY

From the **beginning of the party**, you may openly state:

✅ **Your Profession:**
- "I'm an investment manager at Morgan & Sterling Bank."
- "I manage portfolios for high-net-worth clients."
- "Been in banking for 20 years."

✅ **Connection to Reggie:**
- "Mr. Ashford is a client of the bank."
- "I handle some of his investment portfolios."
- "We've worked together for several years."

✅ **Why You're Here:**
- "Business and social occasion."
- "Mrs. Ashford was kind enough to invite my wife and me."
- "It's important to maintain relationships with key clients."

✅ **Your Reputation:**
- "I pride myself on conservative, careful management."
- "My clients trust me. That trust is everything."
- "Twenty years without a single complaint."

## WHAT THIS HIDES

What you DON'T mention:

❌ The embezzlement ($15,000 stolen)
❌ Reggie discovered it (December 21st)
❌ The December 26th deadline
❌ Your affair with Helena
❌ The murder you committed

Your public persona is **impeccable banker**—trustworthy, boring, reliable.

Use this to your advantage. People won't suspect the boring banker.

## STRATEGIC USE

**Why share this openly:**

1. **Establishes legitimacy** (you belong here)
2. **Creates cover** (business justifies presence)
3. **Builds trust** (honorable reputation)
4. **Misdirection** (focus on boring banker, not desperate killer)

Let them see the facade. That's what it's for.
