# RELATIONSHIPS

## 🔴 HELENA ASHFORD *(Co-Killer/Lover)*
**Connection:** Affair partner, murder accomplice, forbidden love

You love her desperately. She's trapped in abusive marriage. You're trapped in fraud. Together you killed to be free. Now you must pretend you're barely acquainted. The weight is crushing.

**Dynamic:** Secret glances, subtle coordination, shared guilt

## 🔴 EMILIA HARRODS *(Wife/Betrayed)*
**Connection:** Married 16 years, loves you completely, you've destroyed her

This is torture. She trusts you. You've committed murder AND had affair. When she learns truth, it will shatter her. Watching that happen = your punishment.

**Dynamic:** Be kind (it's least you can do), accept her devastation

## 🔴 REGINALD ASHFORD III *(Victim)*
**Connection:** Client, discovered your fraud, gave ultimatum, you murdered him

He was cruel, arrogant, controlling. But he didn't deserve strangulation. You see his face constantly—dying, terrified. That image never leaves.

**Dynamic:** Speak respectfully of him (hide that you killed him)

## 🟡 FILIPP MORETTI *(Unwitting Accomplice)*
**Connection:** Provided murder weapon, doesn't know what it was used for

You lied to him ("gift for musicians"). He trusted you. Now piano wire is evidence. He'll feel guilty even though innocent.

**Dynamic:** Avoid him if possible, guilt shows around him

## 🟡 PADRE RUI SANTOS *(Confessor)*
**Connection:** You confessed everything to him Dec 20th, he couldn't stop you

He knows. The confessional seal prevents him from telling anyone. He tried to dissuade you. You did it anyway. Now he watches, knowing truth.

**Dynamic:** Portuguese mutual respect, shared burden, silent understanding

## 🟡 JC MENDES *(Investigator)*
**Connection:** Will catch you, you know it, respect him for it

He's good at his job. Columbo-style detective. You can't outsmart him. When he presents evidence, confess with dignity. That's all that remains.

**Dynamic:** Professional courtesy, then honest confession

## 🟢 Others *(Various Suspects)*
**Connection:** They provide cover, red herrings, misdirection

Daisy, Maria, twins all have motives. Let investigation explore them. Buys you time. But ultimately doesn't matter—evidence points to you.

**Dynamic:** Professional banker politeness, no special attention
