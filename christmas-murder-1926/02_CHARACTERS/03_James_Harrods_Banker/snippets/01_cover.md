**⚠️ WARNING: KILLER ROLE**

This dossier contains information about your role as **co-murderer** in tonight's crime. You and Helena Ashford planned and executed the murder of Reginald Ashford III. Your challenge is to appear innocent while carrying the weight of what you've done—and ultimately, to confess when the evidence becomes undeniable.

This is a complex emotional role requiring:
- Controlled performance (hide guilt)
- Moral struggle (honor vs. desperation)
- Dramatic confession (final redemption)
