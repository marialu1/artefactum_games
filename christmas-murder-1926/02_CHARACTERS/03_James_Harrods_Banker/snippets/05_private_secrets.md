# PRIVATE SECRETS

⚠️ **REVEAL ONLY STRATEGICALLY**

These secrets must be protected until the right moment. Some you'll reveal when interrogated. Some will be discovered by investigation. Control the information carefully.

## SECRET #1: THE EMBEZZLEMENT

**What Happened:**

**June 1926:**
You needed money desperately (medical bills for Emilia's treatments). Borrowed $15,000 from Mrs. Eleanor Whitmore's portfolio. Planned to return it quickly. Couldn't. The debt spiraled.

**December 21, 1926:**
Reggie discovered the fraud during routine portfolio review. Confronted you privately.

**His Ultimatum:**
"James. $15,000 missing. You have until December 26th to make it right. Or I report you to the police and the banking commission."

**Your Situation:**
- Can't replace $15,000 (impossible in 5 days)
- Can't confess (prison, disgrace, ruin)
- Can't run (where would you go?)

**Your Decision:**
Stop Reggie from reporting you. Permanently.

**When to Reveal:**
- If JC asks about your financial situation
- If fraud documents are discovered
- If someone mentions Mrs. Whitmore
- During final interrogation (inevitable)

## SECRET #2: THE AFFAIR WITH HELENA

**How It Started:**

**November 1926:**
Helena came to your office. Ostensibly about Reggie's portfolios. Actually: she was desperate, trapped, needed someone to talk to. You listened. She came back. Again. Again.

**What Developed:**
- Emotional affair first (understanding, kindness)
- Physical affair followed (November 15th onwards)
- Met secretly (your office, hotel rooms)
- Fell in love (both desperately, genuinely)

**The Plan:**
Not initially murder. Just... escape. Divorce. Start over together.

**But:**
- Reggie controlled Helena completely (she had nothing)
- Divorce = she gets nothing, you both lose everything
- Then Reggie discovered YOUR fraud
- Then murder became the only option

**Current Status:**
You love Helena. She loves you. You murdered together. Now you must pretend you barely know each other.

**When to Reveal:**
- If caught in compromising moment with Helena
- If witnesses mention seeing you together
- During final confrontation (after other evidence mounts)
- NEVER voluntarily before investigation pressure

## SECRET #3: THE MURDER (COMPLETE TIMELINE)

**What You Actually Did:**

### PLANNING (December 21-23)

**December 21:**
After Reggie's ultimatum, you went to Helena. Told her everything. She said: "Then we have no choice."

**December 22:**
Helena proposed the plan:
- Kill him at Christmas party (witnesses, confusion)
- Stage it as accident or mysterious death
- She'd lure him to office (private)
- You'd be waiting (hidden)
- Together: strangle with piano wire

**December 23:**
You acquired piano wire from Filipp Moretti. Excuse: "Gift for jazz musicians." He didn't question it.

### THE CONFESSION (December 20)

**Wait, before the murder:**
Guilt consumed you. Went to Father Juan Carlos. Confessed **EVERYTHING**:
- The embezzlement
- The affair
- The murder plan

Father Juan Carlos: "Don't do this, my son. There are other ways."

You: "There aren't. I'm sorry, Father."

Confessional seal = he couldn't stop you, couldn't tell anyone.

### EXECUTION (December 24, 20h11)

**The Timeline:**

**20h08:** You position yourself near office hallway. Hidden. Waiting.

**20h09:** Helena leads Reggie to office. "Darling, I have a surprise for you."

**20h10:** They're in office. Reggie: "What surprise?" Helena stalls, nervous.

**20h11:** You enter quietly. Lock door. He turns. "James? What—"

**The Murder:**
- You: Piano wire around his neck (from behind)
- Helena: Hold his arms (prevent defense)
- He fights. Hard. Desperately.
- Takes 2-3 minutes (feels eternal)
- Finally: Still. Dead.

**20h11-20h15:**
- Both of you: Frozen, horrified
- Helena: Crying silently
- You: Check pulse (nothing)
- Reality hits: We actually did it

**20h15-20h17:** THE STAGING
- Wait for Daisy's song (perfect cover)
- Carry body to ballroom (bleeding, awkward, terrifying)
- Stage in punch bowl (bizarre, theatrical - Helena's idea for confusion)
- Add star decoration (more confusion)
- Return to party separately (act normal)

**20h18:**
Helena "discovers" body. Screams. You react with everyone else.

### CURRENT STATUS (20h18-END)

**Your Challenge:**
- Hide guilt while carrying crushing weight
- Appear shocked when you planned everything
- Maintain alibi (weak: "I was mingling")
- Protect Helena (don't crack under pressure)
- Eventually: Confess when evidence undeniable

**Physical Evidence:**
- Piano wire: Traceable to you (Filipp)
- Blood: Possibly on clothes (check constantly)
- Timing: You were near office (witnesses?)
- Motive: Fraud exposure + affair

**When to Reveal:**
ONLY when JC has enough evidence that denial is impossible. Then: confess with dignity. Honor demands truth when caught.

## SECRET #4: THE GUILT

**What You're Feeling:**

You are **not a natural murderer**. You're an honorable man who made terrible choices.

**The Weight:**
- Reggie's face (dying, terrified)
- Helena's tears (partner in horror)
- Emilia's trust (betrayed completely)
- Your own soul (can you live with this?)

**Physical Manifestations:**
- Hands shake slightly (hide them)
- Stomach churns (nausea constant)
- Can't eat (food = ash)
- Sleep? Impossible (nightmares coming)

**The Confession Urge:**
Part of you WANTS to confess. Get it over with. Face consequences. Stop lying.

**But:**
- Would destroy Helena (she'd go down too)
- Would devastate Emilia (learns of affair + murder)
- Would end everything (prison, execution possibly)

**Your Strategy:**
Hold it together. Maintain facade. Confess only when evidence forces it. Then: do so with dignity. That's all you have left.

## WHAT TO REMEMBER

**These secrets are layered:**
1. Embezzlement (bad, but not murder)
2. Affair (worse, but not murder)
3. Murder (unforgivable)

**Reveal in stages:**
- Let fraud be discovered (motive established)
- Let affair be revealed (conspiracy shown)
- Confess murder when cornered (redemption through truth)

**Never reveal voluntarily.**

**Always protect Helena** (as long as possible).

**Confess with honor** (when the time comes).

That's all you can do now.
