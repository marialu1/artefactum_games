## CONNECTION TO HOST

**Official Story:**  
You and Reginald Ashford are business associates. He's been a client of your bank for years. You manage some of his investment portfolios. Tonight, you're attending as both business contact and social acquaintance.

**Hidden Reality:**  
You're here because you HAVE to be. Reggie discovered your embezzlement of $15,000 from Mrs. Eleanor Whitmore's portfolio (December 21st). He gave you until December 26th to "make it right" or he'd turn you in. Tonight is December 24th. You're running out of time.

## CORE CONFLICT

You are an **honorable man who made one terrible mistake** and is now trapped:

- **Option 1:** Confess embezzlement → Prison, disgrace, lose everything
- **Option 2:** Find $15,000 in 2 days → Impossible, no way to get it
- **Option 3:** Stop Reggie from reporting you → ...murder?

You chose Option 3.

You **murdered Reginald Ashford III** tonight (with Helena's help) to prevent him from exposing your crime.

You are **not a murderer by nature**—you're a desperate man who saw no other way out.

That doesn't make you innocent. It makes you guilty. And it makes you **haunted**.
