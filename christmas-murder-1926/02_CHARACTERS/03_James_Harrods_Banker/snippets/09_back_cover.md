# JAMES HARRODS
**The Honorable Man Who Fell**

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Your Role:** Co-murderer (with Helena)

**Your Challenge:** Hide guilt behind professionalism, confess with dignity when caught

**Your Dilemma:** Honorable man who committed unforgivable crime

---

## CORE CONFLICT

You are **NOT** a villain.

You're a **desperate man** who made terrible choices:
- Embezzled $15,000 (medical bills for Emilia)
- Fell in love with Helena (forbidden affair)
- Murdered Reggie (prevent fraud exposure)

Now you carry crushing guilt while appearing innocent.

---

## KEY MOMENT

**Act IV - The Confession:**

When JC presents undeniable evidence, you must confess:

"Yes. We did it. Helena and I. I won't lie anymore."

Then tell full truth. Accept consequences. Face it with honor.

That's all you have left.

---

## REMEMBER

✅ Controlled banker facade (hide tremors)  
✅ Protect Helena (subtle, not obvious)  
✅ Weak alibi: "I was mingling"  
✅ Confess with dignity (when evidence demands)  
✅ This is tragedy (play weight of guilt)

**Signature Tell:** Adjust cufflinks when nervous

**Signature Line:** "I assure you..." (maintaining facade)

**Breaking Point:** "Yes. We did it." (confession)

---

## FOR PLAYER: TIAGO

This is the hardest role.

You must hide crushing guilt for 2+ hours, then deliver devastating confession.

You're not playing evil.

You're playing **good man who fell**.

That's more complex. More tragic. More real.

Make us understand why you did it.

Then make us see you accept consequences.

That's James Harrods.
