## SECRET #1: WHY YOU LEFT THE NYPD (1921)

**The Corruption Scandal That Ended Your Career**

**What Happened:**

**April 1921:**
- Murder at speakeasy (Tommy Chen, Chinese bartender)
- Initial ruling: "Robbery gone wrong"
- Your investigation: Police captain ordered hit (Chen witnessed $5,000 bribe)

**The Evidence You Found:**
- Witness statements
- Ballistics (police-issue weapon)
- Financial records (captain's sudden wealth)
- Timeline (captain had no alibi)

**Your Choice:**
Report it. Expose corruption. Do the right thing.

**The Retaliation:**
- Captain's friends retaliated
- Evidence "disappeared"
- Witnesses intimidated
- You accused of fabricating case
- Forced resignation (June 1921)

**Current Status:**
Five years later, no regrets. Did right thing. Would do again.

**Relevance Tonight:**
- Don't trust authority (knows it's corruptible)
- Protect innocents fiercely (saw them destroyed)
- Pursue truth relentlessly (regardless of power)
- Expect resistance (powerful don't want exposure)

## SECRET #2: YOUR WIFE'S DEATH (1918)

**Maria Mendes - The Grief That Never Fully Healed**

**Who She Was:**
- Born 1883 (Porto, Portugal)
- Married 1903 (you were 22, young love)
- Seamstress, warm, practical
- Tried for children (3 miscarriages, heartbreaking)
- Your anchor, your home

**October 1918:**
Spanish flu pandemic. Maria got sick.

**October 28, 1918:**
Maria died. Age 35.

**Her Last Words:**
"João... don't stop. Don't let grief make you cruel. And... find someone. Don't be alone forever."

**Your Response:**
"There's nobody else. Only you."

**Eight Years Later (1926):**
- Still hurts (grief never fully heals)
- Never dated again (can't imagine replacing her)
- Keeps her photo (beside bed)
- Wears her gift (pocket watch)
- Talks to her (when alone, asks advice)

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- Work (if busy, can't dwell on death)
- Helping others (giving closure = meaning)
- Memory (keeps her alive through stories)
- Faith (not religious, but hopes she's waiting)

**Relevance Tonight:**

**Empathy for Emilia:**
- Recognizes her pain (loving someone who doesn't love back)
- Gentle with her (sees Maria's kindness)
- Protective when she breaks (suicide threat)

**Understanding Desperate Love:**
- James/Helena killed for love
- Understands motivation (grief makes people desperate)
- Doesn't excuse it (murder is murder)
- But GETS it

**Personal Stakes:**
- Last case of contract (fate? Maria's guidance?)
- Solving it = honoring her (she'd want justice)

## SECRET #3: THE INVESTIGATION STRATEGY

**How You Will Solve This Murder**

**Phase 1: Observation (20h18-20h30)**
- Secure scene
- Note cause of death (strangulation, not drowning)
- Staging (star, punch bowl = theatrical)
- Watch reactions (who's genuinely shocked?)

**Phase 2: Initial Interviews (20h30-21h00)**
- Quick questions for everyone
- Establish timelines
- Note inconsistencies (don't challenge yet)
- Let them think you're slow

**Phase 3: Evidence Gathering (21h00-21h30)**
- Piano wire (murder weapon)
- Blood trail (office to ballroom)
- Timeline (Daisy's song = cover)
- Documents (fraud records)

**Phase 4: Focused Interrogation (21h30-22h00)**
- Target prime suspects (James, Helena)
- Use Columbo techniques
- Timeline traps
- Evidence reveals

**Phase 5: Confrontation (22h00-22h30)**
- Present evidence
- Identify killers
- Offer chance to confess
- Accept confession with dignity

**Key Deductions:**

**Two Killers:**
- Strangulation requires two people
- Wire + restraint = coordinated

**Office Murder:**
- Blood trail proves body moved
- Staged in ballroom for confusion

**Daisy's Song = Cover:**
- Perfect timing (20h15-20h17)
- All guests watching

**Helena + James:**
- Both missing during window
- James bought wire
- Fraud motive + affair motive
- Combined: love + desperation

## WHAT TO REMEMBER

These secrets inform your **approach**, not your **guilt**.

You're not hiding crimes.

You're carrying wounds.

And those wounds make you **better** at this job:
- Corruption experience = don't trust power
- Wife's death = understand desperate love
- Both = pursue truth with compassion

**That's why you're good at what you do.**

Not despite the pain.

**Because of it.**
