# JOÃO CARLOS MENDES
**The Quiet Man Who Solves Murders**

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Your Role:** Lead Investigator (Innocent)

**Your Challenge:** Solve murder + manage game + stay in character

**Your Method:** Columbo approach (humble but brilliant)

---

## CORE APPROACH

**The Columbo Method:**
1. Appear bumbling (performance)
2. Observe everything (truth)
3. Ask gently (strategy)
4. Wait patiently (time works)
5. Catch them (inevitable)

**Your Signature Move:** "The Turn"
- End interview
- Walk to door
- Stop, turn back
- "Oh, just one more thing..."
- Deliver killer question

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Killers:** James Harrods + Helena Ashford

**Method:** Strangulation (piano wire, co-conspiracy)

**Motive:** Fraud exposure + escape marriage + forbidden love

**Evidence:** Wire purchase + fraud docs + affair + weak alibis

**Your Job:** Find truth. Present with dignity. Accept confession.

## REMEMBER

✅ You're Columbo - bumbling genius

✅ Be patient - silences work

✅ Be kind - understanding = confessions

✅ Practice "The Turn"

✅ Manage game pacing

✅ Protect innocent (Emilia, Filipp)

✅ Respect guilty (when they confess)

**Signature Line:** "Just one more question..."

**Hidden Pain:** Wife Maria (died 1918), NYPD corruption (forced out 1921)

**Hidden Goal:** Honor Maria's memory through justice

## FOR PLAYER: JC

This is the hardest role.

You must solve, perform, and facilitate simultaneously.

But when you present evidence at climax?

When they confess?

When justice is served?

**Worth it.**

You're the one who brings truth.
