# PUBLIC SECRET

## WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

From **ACT I** (after body discovered), you may state openly:

✅ **Professional Background:**
- "Former NYPD detective, 20 years service"
- "Retired 1921, now private investigator"
- "Worked murder cases mostly"
- "Specialized in difficult puzzles"

✅ **Presence at Party:**
- "Mrs. Ashford hired me last month"
- "Security consultant for social events"
- "$200 contract, November through December"
- "Tonight's the last night of my contract, actually"

✅ **Investigation Authority:**
- "Well, technically I'm already employed here"
- "Guess that makes this my case, if nobody objects"
- "I'll need to ask everyone some questions"
- "Just standard procedure, you understand"

✅ **Your Approach:**
- "I know this is shocking, but best thing we can do is figure out what happened"
- "I'll try to make this as quick and painless as possible"
- "Former detective - seen a few of these before"

## WHAT THIS ACCOMPLISHES

**Strategic Benefits:**

1. **Establishes Authority:** Legitimate investigator, not random guest
2. **Explains Presence:** Hired = supposed to be here
3. **Creates Irony:** Hired by killer to investigate her own murder (you don't know this yet)
4. **Permits Questioning:** Professional duty, not nosiness
5. **Sets Tone:** Calm, professional, in control

## DELIVERY EXAMPLE

[After Helena's scream, body discovered]

**YOU:** [Steps forward calmly]

"Folks, I need everyone to stay calm."

[Pulls out notebook]

"My name is John Alfred Jones. Former NYPD detective. Mrs. Ashford hired me as security consultant. Which means this investigation falls to me until police arrive."

[Kind but firm tone]

"I know you're shocked. I am too. But the best thing we can do for Mr. Ashford now is figure out what happened."

[Looks around room]

"I'll need to speak with each of you. Please remain in this room. Nobody touch anything."

[To Helena]

"Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there somewhere you'd like to sit?"

---

This establishes you as **lead investigator** while maintaining your **humble, helpful demeanor**.

You're taking charge, but apologetically.

Classic Columbo.
