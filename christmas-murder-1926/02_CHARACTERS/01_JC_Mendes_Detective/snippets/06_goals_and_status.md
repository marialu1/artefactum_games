# GOALS & STATUS

## YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

### PRIMARY GOAL: Solve the Murder

**What This Means:**
1. Identify killer(s) → James + Helena
2. Establish method → Strangulation with piano wire
3. Determine motive → Fraud exposure + forbidden love
4. Gather proof → Evidence that holds up

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct identification (co-killers)
- Complete timeline (20h11-20h18)
- Confession obtained (or evidence irrefutable)
- Other suspects cleared

### SECONDARY GOAL: Manage the Game

**The Meta-Challenge:**

You're both **detective** AND **facilitator**:
- Keep investigation moving (don't stall)
- Give everyone screen time (interview all)
- Pace clue reveals (not too fast/slow)
- Build to dramatic revelation

**Pacing Guide:**
- **Act I:** Initial questions (quick, everyone)
- **Act II-III:** Deep dives (suspects focus)
- **Act IV:** Evidence confrontation
- **Act V:** Final accusation

### TERTIARY GOAL: Protect the Innocent

**JC's Moral Code:**

Not just catching guilty—also protecting innocent.

**Specific Concerns:**

**Emilia:**
- Will be destroyed by truth
- Watch for suicide risk (you've seen this before)
- Offer comfort where possible

**Filipp:**
- Unwittingly provided murder weapon
- Will feel guilty (even though innocent)
- Reassure him he's not culpable

**Red Herrings:**
- Daisy, Twins, others have motives
- Could be falsely accused
- Establish their innocence clearly

### HIDDEN GOAL: Personal Redemption

**What You Don't Say Aloud:**

This case matters beyond duty:

**Last Case of Contract:**
- Final investigation before contract ends
- Feels like fate (Maria guiding?)
- Want to end with truth (honor her memory)

**Corruption Echo:**
- Helena hired investigator to cover murder (using system corruptly)
- Reminds you of NYPD (power manipulating justice)
- Proving truth = small victory

**Widow's Grief:**
- See Maria in Emilia (innocent woman destroyed)
- Couldn't save Maria (flu took her)
- Maybe can save Emilia? (Or at least try)

## THE SOLUTION

**The Killers:** James Harrods + Helena Ashford

**The Method:** Strangulation with piano wire (co-conspiracy)

**The Motive:** 
- James: Prevent fraud exposure (Reggie would turn him in Dec 26)
- Helena: Escape abusive marriage (couldn't divorce, had nothing)
- Together: Forbidden love (affair since November)

**The Timeline:**
- 20h09: Helena lures Reggie to office
- 20h11: James enters, they strangle him together
- 20h15-20h17: Move body during Daisy's song
- 20h18: Helena "discovers" body (staged)

**The Evidence:**
- Piano wire (James bought from Filipp, Dec 21)
- Fraud documents (motive)
- Affair witnesses (conspiracy)
- Weak alibis (both near office)
- Blood trail (body moved)

**Your Job:**
Find this truth. Present it with dignity.

Let them confess when cornered.

That's justice.
