**TONIGHT YOU ARE:**

The former NYPD detective hired as "security consultant" by Helena Ashford. When her husband is murdered at the party, you naturally become the lead investigator. 

You seem bumbling, apologetic, slow to understand.

That's all performance.

You're actually brilliant.

And you're going to solve this.
