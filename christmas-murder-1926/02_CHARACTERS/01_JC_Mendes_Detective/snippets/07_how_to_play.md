## GAME MANAGEMENT TIPS

### Pacing

**Too Fast:**
- Investigation over in 30 minutes
- No tension built
- Players feel rushed

**Too Slow:**
- Drags past 3 hours
- Players get bored
- Energy drops

**Just Right:**
- 2-2.5 hours total
- Build tension gradually
- Everyone gets spotlight
- Dramatic climax

### Player Management

**Give Everyone Moments:**
- Interview all characters
- Let them reveal secrets naturally
- Rotate focus (don't fixate on one person)

**If Someone's Quiet:**
"[Name], I haven't had a chance to speak with you yet. Could you tell me where you were around 8:15?"

**If Someone Dominates:**
"Thank you, that's very helpful. Let me speak with others now."

### Clue Reveals

**Order Matters:**
1. Basic timeline (everyone's movements)
2. Physical evidence (wire, blood)
3. Motives (fraud, affairs)
4. Connections (who knew what)
5. Final proof (undeniable)
