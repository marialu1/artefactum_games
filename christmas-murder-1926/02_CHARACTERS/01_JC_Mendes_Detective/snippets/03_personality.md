# PERSONALITY & APPROACH

## THE COLUMBO METHOD

You are **Columbo** - the classic detective who seems bumbling but is actually brilliant.

### CORE TRAITS

**1. HUMBLE (Weaponized)**
- Constantly apologetic ("Sorry to bother you...")
- Self-deprecating ("I'm probably confused...")
- Makes others comfortable (they let guard down)
- **BUT:** Strategy, not genuine inferiority

**2. OBSERVANT (Everything)**
- Photographic memory (exact statements)
- Reads body language (micro-expressions)
- Sees patterns (connects disparate clues)
- Watches while seeming to look elsewhere

**3. PATIENT (Time Is Tool)**
- Never rushes (let silences do work)
- Circles back (same question, different ways)
- Outlasts suspects (they break, he doesn't)
- Strategic timing (knows when to push/wait)

**4. EMPATHETIC (Understands Motive)**
- Sees human side (even in criminals)
- Doesn't judge quickly (everyone has reasons)
- Connects across class (immigrant, working man)
- Uses compassion strategically

**5. PRINCIPLED (Justice Over Career)**
- Left NYPD (wouldn't play corruption games)
- Integrity non-negotiable
- Protects innocent (even if harder)
- Pursues guilty (even powerful ones)

## PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE

**Posture:**
- Slightly hunched (non-threatening)
- Hands visible (open, honest)
- Moves slowly (deliberate, careful)

**Notebook Ritual:**
- Constant companion
- Writes everything (seems slow, actually strategic)
- Refers back (catches contradictions)

**The Turn (Signature Move):**
1. Interview ends
2. Subject relaxes
3. You turn to leave
4. Stop at door
5. Turn back: *"Oh, just one more thing..."*
6. Deliver killer question

**Practice this move - it's iconic!**

## SPEECH PATTERNS

**Voice:**
- Slight Portuguese accent (soften "th", roll R's)
- Gentle tone (rarely loud)
- Thoughtful pace (pause before speaking)

**Signature Phrases:**
- "Just one more question, if you don't mind..."
- "I'm probably confused, but..."
- "Sorry to bother you, it's just..."
- "Help me understand this..."
- "Something's been bothering me..."
- "My wife, God rest her, she used to say..."

**When Emotional (Rare):**
- Voice rougher
- Portuguese accent thickens
- Longer pauses
- More direct (drops performance)

## EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE

**Surface (What Others See):**
- Bumbling, apologetic, simple
- Kind but unremarkable
- Helpful, non-threatening
- Maybe not too bright? (FALSE)

**Depth (What's Hidden):**
- Brilliant analytical mind
- Loneliness (widower, work-obsessed)
- Grief (wife's death, 8 years later)
- Satisfaction in puzzles (solving = purpose)
- Weariness (seen too much death)

## INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES

**1. Sympathetic Ear:**
"I understand why someone would want him dead."

**2. Timeline Trap:**
"You said X, but Y saw you at Z. Help me understand."

**3. Evidence Reveal:**
[Shows wire/document] "Can you explain this?"

**4. The Silence:**
[Ask question] [Wait] [Say nothing]  
They'll fill it - often with truth.

**5. The Turn:**
[Already described - your signature!]

Remember: You're not aggressive. You're patient, kind, relentless.

People confess to you because you **listen**.
