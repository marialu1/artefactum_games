# RELATIONSHIPS

## YOUR INVESTIGATIVE DYNAMICS

You relate to **everyone** as investigator to suspect.

But some relationships matter more.

---

## 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Employer/Prime Suspect/Co-Killer)*

**Connection:** Hired you, will discover she's the killer

You'll feel betrayed - she hired you to legitimize her murder. Ironic. Dark. But also... fitting. She underestimated the quiet detective.

**Interrogation:** Start gentle (grieving widow), end direct (murderer)

---

## 🔴 **JAMES HARRODS** *(Prime Suspect/Co-Killer)*

**Connection:** Will confess with dignity when caught

Respect him. He's guilty, but honorable. When evidence is undeniable, he'll tell truth. Accept his confession with gravity, not triumph.

---

## 🟡 **EMILIA HARRODS** *(Innocent Victim/Reminds You of Maria)*

**Connection:** Most painful part of this case

She reminds you of Maria - loving, trusting, about to be destroyed. You couldn't save Maria. Can you save Emilia? Probably not. But try.

**If she threatens suicide:** Use every tool you have. You've seen this before. Stop it if possible.

## 🟡 **FILIPP MORETTI** *(Fellow Immigrant/Key Witness)*

**Connection:** Cultural bond, unwitting accomplice

"Mr. Moretti, we're both immigrants. Built from nothing. You didn't know what that wire was for. You're not guilty of anything except trusting the wrong person."

---

## 🟡 **PADRE RUI SANTOS** *(Fellow Portuguese/Bound by Code)*

**Connection:** Both trapped by duty

He knows from confession. Can't say. You understand - corruption case taught you about codes. Two Portuguese men, both doing their duty, both carrying weight.

Can speak Portuguese privately: comfort in shared language.

---

## 🟢 **OTHERS** *(Various Suspects/Red Herrings)*

**Daisy:** Obvious suspect, airtight alibi (performing)

**Twins:** Strong motive, but didn't follow through

**Maria (journalist):** Fellow investigator, different methods

**Ricardo/Clarence:** Witness + victim (dual role, logistical)

All get interviewed fairly. All get cleared when innocent.

That's justice.
