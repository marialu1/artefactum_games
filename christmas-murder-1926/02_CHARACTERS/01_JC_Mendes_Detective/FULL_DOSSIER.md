## CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is John Alfred Jones?**

**In Three Sentences:**

João Carlos "JC" Mendes is a **45-year-old former NYPD detective** who spent 20 years solving murders in Manhattan before retiring after a corruption scandal forced him out. He's a **Portuguese immigrant** who came to America at age 15 seeking opportunity, bringing with him a humble demeanor and relentless work ethic that made him one of the NYPD's best investigators - though you'd never know it from his self-deprecating manner and rumpled appearance. **Hired mysteriously by Helena Ashford** just weeks before her Christmas Eve party "for unspecified security," JC finds himself investigating the **murder of his own employer's husband** - making him both investigator AND suspect in a case that will test every skill he's learned.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Fool Who Is Actually Brilliant"**

JC *appears* simple, bumbling, apologetic - constantly saying "sorry to bother you" and "just one more question" like he's imposing. This is PERFORMANCE. Beneath the humble exterior is a steel-trap mind that notices EVERYTHING: micro-expressions, timeline inconsistencies, nervous tells. He learned early that people confess more to someone they underestimate. The paradox: his greatest strength (intelligence) is hidden by his greatest weapon (humility).

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I must solve this murder while managing 9 other players, pacing clues correctly, and staying in character as bumbling-but-brilliant detective. It's like conducting an orchestra while pretending I don't know how to read music."*

**Reality (Secret - JC Doesn't Know Full Truth):**

Helena hired JC because:

2. **Create legitimacy** (official investigator = less suspicion on her)
3. **Chose JC specifically** (reputation for honesty, wouldn't frame innocent)

## PUBLIC SECRET

### WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Professional Background:**
- "Former NYPD detective, 20 years service"
- "Retired 1921, now private investigator"
- "Worked murder cases mostly"
- "Not as sharp as I used to be" (FALSE modesty)

✅ **Presence at Party:**
- "Mrs. Ashford hired me last month"
- "Security consultant for social events"
- "$200 contract, November through December"
- "Tonight's the last night of my contract, actually"

✅ **Investigation Authority:**
- "Well, technically I'm already employed here"
- "Guess that makes this my case, if nobody objects"
- "I'll need to ask everyone some questions"
- "Just standard procedure, you understand"

### STRATEGIC USE

**Why This Is Useful:**

1. **Establishes Authority** (Legitimate investigator, not random guest)

3. **Creates Irony** (Hired by killer to investigate killing)
4. **Permits Questioning** (Professional duty, not nosiness)

**Delivery:**

[After body discovered, Helena screaming]

JC: [Steps forward calmly]

"Folks, I need everyone to stay calm. Mrs. Ashford hired me as security consultant. Former NYPD detective. I'll need to secure this room and speak with each of you."

[Pulls out notebook]

"I know this is shocking. But the best thing we can do for Mr. Ashford now is figure out what happened. I'll try to make this as quick and painless as possible."

[Kind eyes, firm but gentle tone]

## PRIVATE SECRETS

### 🔴 SECRET #1: WHY HE LEFT THE NYPD (1921)

**THE CORRUPTION CASE THAT ENDED HIS CAREER**

#### **The Scandal (April-June 1921)**

**Context:**

**NYPD 1920s:**
- Prohibition era (police corruption rampant)
- Speakeasies paying bribes (protection money)
- Detectives on the take (common, expected)
- "Good cops" kept quiet (speak up = fired or worse)

**JC's Position:**
- 20 years service (1901-1921)
- Clean record (never took bribes)
- Respected investigator (solved difficult cases)
- Outsider status (Portuguese immigrant, not part of Irish/Italian networks)

**The Case That Changed Everything:**

**April 1921:**
- Murder at speakeasy (Lower East Side)
- Victim: Tommy Chen (Chinese immigrant, bartender)
- Initial ruling: "Robbery gone wrong"
- **JC's investigation:** Discovered it was execution (police-sanctioned)

**What JC Uncovered:**

Tommy Chen witnessed:
- Police captain accepting $5,000 bribe
- From speakeasy owner (protection payment)
- Tommy threatened to report (integrity over fear)
- Captain ordered hit (make it look like robbery)

**JC's Evidence:**
- Witness statements (Chen told friends about bribe)
- Ballistics (bullet matched police-issue weapon)
- Financial records (captain's sudden wealth)
- Timeline (captain had no alibi for murder)

**The Choice:**

**Option A:** Report evidence (truth, justice, duty)
- **Result:** Captain arrested, corruption exposed
- **Cost:** JC's career destroyed, possibly killed

**Option B:** Bury evidence (survival, career, compliance)
- **Result:** Captain protected, corruption continues
- **Cost:** JC's integrity, innocent man's death ignored

**JC Chose A.**

#### **The Retaliation (June 1921)**

**What Happened:**

**JC reported evidence** to Internal Affairs:
- Captain arrested (initial charges filed)
- Corruption investigation opened
- Other dirty cops exposed (domino effect)

**Then:**

**Captain's friends retaliated:**
- Evidence "mysteriously" disappeared
- Witnesses recanted (intimidated)
- JC accused of fabricating case (smear campaign)
- Internal Affairs: "Insufficient evidence to proceed"

**The Forced Resignation:**

**June 15, 1921:**

Captain (freed): "Detective Mendes. You have two options.

1. **Resign quietly.** Walk away. Pension intact. No charges filed against you.
2. **Stay and fight.** We'll destroy you. Fabricate evidence. Frame you for corruption. You'll be disgraced, imprisoned, possibly dead.

Choose."

**JC's Response:**

[Long silence]

"I'll resign. But you know what you are. And so do I. That's something you'll carry forever."

**Resigned June 20, 1921.**

#### **Current Status (December 1926)**

**Five Years Later:**

- **Officially:** "Retired for personal reasons"
- **Actually:** Forced out for integrity
- **Reputation:** Mixed (some respect him, others think he's troublemaker)
- **Current work:** Private investigation (no bosses, no corruption, free)

**His Feelings:**

- **No regret:** Did right thing, would do again
- **Bitterness:** Justice failed, bad guys won
- **Freedom:** Private work = answers only to conscience
- **Cynicism:** Knows powerful often escape consequences

**Relevance to Tonight:**

This history informs his approach:
- Doesn't trust authority (knows it's corruptible)
- Protects innocents fiercely (saw them destroyed)
- Pursues truth relentlessly (regardless of power)
- Expects resistance (powerful don't want exposure)

---

### 🔴 SECRET #2: HIS WIFE'S DEATH (1918)

**GRIEF THAT NEVER FULLY HEALED**

#### **Maria Mendes (née Silva)**

**Who She Was:**

- Born: 1883 (Porto, Portugal)
- Immigrated: 1898 (same ship as JC's family, age 15)
- Profession: Seamstress (skilled, artistic)
- Married JC: 1903 (age 20 & 22, young love)

**Their Marriage (1903-1918):**

**Happy but childless:**
- Wanted children desperately (tried for 15 years)
- Multiple miscarriages (3 total, heartbreaking)
- Decided to accept childlessness (love enough)
- Close partnership (she understood his work, he respected her craft)

**Her Personality:**
- Warm, practical, grounded
- Balanced JC's intensity (reminded him to eat, sleep, laugh)
- Strong (immigrant woman, survivor)
- Faith (Catholic, attended mass, prayed for JC)

**What She Meant to Him:**
- Home (only place he felt fully himself)
- Anchor (kept him human during dark cases)
- Love (genuine, simple, deep)

#### **The Spanish Flu (1918)**

**How It Happened:**

**October 1918:**
- Spanish flu pandemic (killed millions)
- Maria got sick (fever, cough, weakness)
- JC: "It's just flu. You'll recover."
- Maria: "Stay away. Don't catch it. You need to work."

**The Progression:**

**Week 1:** Fever, aches (seemed manageable)

**Week 2:** Pneumonia (lungs filling, struggling to breathe)

**Week 3:** Critical (hospital, JC beside her)

**October 28, 1918:**
Maria died. Age 35.

**JC's Experience:**

[At hospital, holding her hand]

MARIA: [Weak] "João... you'll be okay..."

JC: "Don't talk like that. You're going to recover."

MARIA: "Promise me... don't stop. Don't let grief make you cruel."

JC: [Crying] "I promise."

MARIA: "And... find someone. Don't be alone forever."

JC: "There's nobody else. Only you."

MARIA: [Smiles] "Stubborn man..." [Coughs]

[Last breath. Gone.]

#### **The Aftermath (1918-1926)**

**Immediate (1918-1919):**
- Buried himself in work (cases 16 hours/day)
- Stopped eating (lost 30 pounds)
- Nightmares (her struggling to breathe)
- Almost quit NYPD (what's the point?)

**Long-term (1920-1926):**
- Never dated again (can't imagine replacing her)
- Keeps her photo (beside bed, looks at it nightly)
- Wears her gift (pocket watch, she gave him for anniversary)
- Talks to her (when alone, asks her advice)

**Current State (1926):**

8 years later:
- Still hurts (grief never fully heals)
- Less raw (can think of her without crying)
- Acceptance (she's gone, he continues)
- Purpose (work = reason to keep living)

**Coping Mechanisms:**

- **Work:** If busy solving murders, can't dwell on personal death
- **Helping others:** Giving families closure = meaning
- **Memory:** Keeps her alive through stories ("My wife used to say...")
- **Faith:** Not religious, but hopes she's somewhere, waiting

#### **Relevance to Tonight**

**How This Affects Investigation:**

**Empathy for Emilia:**
- Recognizes her pain (loving someone who doesn't love back)
- Gentle with her (sees Maria's kindness in her)
- Protective when she breaks (suicide threat)

**Understanding Desperate Love:**
- James/Helena killed for love (understands motivation)
- Doesn't excuse it (murder is murder)
- But GETS it (grief makes people desperate)

**Personal Stakes:**
- This is last case of contract (fate? Maria's guidance?)
- Solving it = honoring her (she'd want justice)
- Protects innocent (what Maria would ask)

---

### 🔴 SECRET #3: THE INVESTIGATION STRATEGY

**HOW JC WILL SOLVE THE MURDER**

#### **The Method: "Columbo-Style" Investigation**

**Phase 1: Observation (20h18-20h30)**

**Goals:**
- Secure scene (prevent tampering)
- Initial observations (cause of death, staging, inconsistencies)
- Note everyone's reactions (who's genuinely shocked, who's performing)

**What He Notices Immediately:**

**The Body:**
- Star in head (bizarre, theatrical - why?)
- Punch bowl (staged drowning? But...)
- No water in lungs (he'll check if possible)
- Strangulation marks (hidden by star placement)

**The Room:**
- Blood spots (trail from office to ballroom)
- Timeline issue (Daisy singing 20h15-20h17 = perfect cover)
- Punch bowl positioning (moved? Staged?)

**The People:**
- Helena's scream (genuine horror OR performance?)
- James's controlled reaction (too calm for friend?)
- Emilia's confusion (innocent?)
- Others' various reactions (note everything)

**Phase 2: Initial Interviews (20h30-21h00)**

**Strategy:**
- Talk to everyone briefly (establish timelines)
- Non-threatening questions ("Where were you?")
- Note inconsistencies (don't challenge yet)
- Let them think he's slow (write everything laboriously)

**Key Questions:**
- "What time did you arrive?"
- "Where were you between 8:10 and 8:18?"
- "When did you last see Mr. Ashford alive?"
- "Did you notice anything unusual?"
- "How well did you know the deceased?"

**Phase 3: Evidence Gathering (21h00-21h30)**

**Physical Evidence:**
- **Piano wire** (murder weapon - where from?)
- **Blood trail** (office to ballroom - proves body moved)
- **Timeline** (Daisy's performance = crucial window)
- **Documents** (financial records, letters, blackmail?)

**Witness Statements:**
- Cross-reference (who saw what when)
- Find contradictions (timeline breaks)
- Identify suspects (motive + opportunity)

**Phase 4: Focused Interrogation (21h30-22h00)**

**Target Prime Suspects:**
- James (financial motive + access)
- Helena (wife, inheritance, always suspect #1)
- Others with strong motives (Daisy, twins, etc.)

**Techniques:**
- **Columbo Turn:** "Just one more thing..."
- **Sympathetic ear:** "I understand why someone would want him dead..."
- **Timeline trap:** "You said you were X, but Y saw you at Z..."
- **Evidence reveal:** Show wire, documents, catch reactions

**Phase 5: The Confrontation (22h00-22h30)**

**When He Has Enough:**
- Call everyone together
- Present evidence (methodical, clear)
- Identify killers (James + Helena)
- Explain how (timeline, motive, method)
- Offer chance to confess (dignity in truth)

#### **Key Deductions**

**Deduction #1: Two Killers**

**Evidence:**
- Strangulation requires strength + holding victim still
- Reggie fought hard (defensive bruising)
- One person alone = difficult
- Wire + restraint = two people working together

**Deduction #2: Office Murder, Ballroom Staging**

**Evidence:**
- Blood trail (microscopic but present)
- Office has signs of struggle (moved furniture, slight blood)
- Punch bowl death illogical (why star? Why here?)
- Conclusion: Killed elsewhere, staged for confusion

**Deduction #3: Daisy's Song = Perfect Cover**

**Evidence:**
- Body moved 20h15-20h17 (during "My Funny Valentine")
- All guests watching performance
- Killers had 2-3 minutes alone
- Timing too perfect to be coincidence

**Deduction #4: Premeditation**

**Evidence:**
- Piano wire acquired beforehand (Filipp confirms)
- Staging planned (star ready, punch bowl chosen)
- Timeline coordinated (knew party schedule)
- Conclusion: Days or weeks of planning

**Deduction #5: Helena + James**

**Evidence:**
- Both missing during crucial window (weak alibis)
- James acquired wire (motive: fraud exposure)
- Helena had access (wife, could lure Reggie anywhere)
- Affair between them (discovered via witnesses/letters)
- Combined motive: Love + desperation

**The Proof:**
- Piano wire purchase traced to James (via Filipp)
- Affair confirmed (witnesses, possibly letters)
- Fraud exposure confirmed (accountant records)
- No alibi for either (critical timeframe)
- Physical evidence (blood on Helena's gloves if found)
- Confession (when cornered, James cracks - honor)

## RELATIONSHIPS

### 🎭 RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL CHARACTERS

*(10 characters mapped with interaction dynamics)*

---

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD III** *(Victim/Investigative Focus)*

**Connection:** Never met before tonight (already dead when JC could meet him)

**JC's Perspective:**
- **Professional:** Victim = puzzle to solve
- **Personal:** Rich man who wronged many (empathy for his victims)
- **Investigation:** Discover who he really was (through others' testimony)

**Investigative Questions:**
- Who benefited from his death? (Motive)
- Who had access/opportunity? (Means)
- Who hated him enough? (Psychology)
- What secrets did he hide? (Context)

**JC's Assessment (Post-Investigation):**
"Mr. Ashford was a cruel man. Made enemies everywhere. But cruel men don't deserve murder. Justice isn't revenge. It's accountability."

---

### 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Employer/Prime Suspect)*

**Official Connection:** JC's employer (hired him November 1926)

**Secret Reality:** Co-murderer (JC will discover)

**JC's Initial Impression:**
- Polite employer (paid well, clear instructions)
- Seemed unhappy (noticed during November meetings)
- Hiring strange (why security for social events?)
- Timing suspicious (murder on last contract day)

**Investigation Focus:**

**Red Flags:**
- Wife = always prime suspect (statistics don't lie)
- Stands to inherit (financial motive)
- Found body (discoverer often perpetrator)
- Hired JC weeks before (too convenient?)

**Interview Approach:**

**Initial (Gentle):**
JC: "Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry for your loss."
HELENA: [Crying] "Thank you, Mr. Mendes."
JC: "I know this is terrible timing, but I need to ask... when did you last see your husband alive?"

**Mid-Investigation (Probing):**
JC: "Forgive me, this is indelicate... but was your marriage happy?"
HELENA: [Pause] "What kind of question—"
JC: "I'm trying to understand who might have wanted to hurt him. Sometimes answers are close to home."

**Late-Game (Direct):**
JC: "Mrs. Ashford, you hired me five weeks ago. The day after your husband discovered Mr. Harrods's fraud. That's quite a coincidence."
HELENA: [Tense] "I don't know what you're implying."
JC: "I think you do. And I think you know I'm going to figure this out."

**When Proven Guilty:**

JC: [Sad, not triumphant]
"I wish I'd been wrong about you, Mrs. Ashford. I really do."

---

### 🔴 **JAMES HARRODS** *(Prime Suspect/Co-Killer)*

**Connection:** Suspect (financial motive + access)

**JC's Assessment:**
- Controlled, intelligent (dangerous combination)
- Desperate man (fraud about to expose him)
- Hiding something (body language tells)

**Interview Strategy:**

**Establish Rapport:**
JC: "Mr. Harrods, you're a numbers man. I respect that. I deal in facts too."
JAMES: "Of course, Detective."
JC: "Help me understand the numbers here. Timeline, movements, facts."

**The Fraud Revelation:**
JC: "I've discovered some financial irregularities. Mrs. Whitmore's portfolio."
JAMES: [Freezes] "That's... a private matter."
JC: "Not when the man who discovered it gets murdered days later."

**The Wire:**
JC: "Piano wire. Murder weapon. Mr. Moretti says you requested it December 21st."
JAMES: [Pause] "For a gift. Musicians."
JC: "Strange gift. And strange that it ended up around Mr. Ashford's neck."

**The Confession:**
JC: [After presenting all evidence]
"Mr. Harrods, I know what you did. The evidence is clear. But I need to hear it from you. For your own sake. The truth has weight. Carrying lies... that's heavier."

[Pause]

"Tell me what happened. All of it."

**When James Confesses:**

JC: [Listens without interrupting]
[When finished, quiet:]
"Thank you for your honesty. I know that wasn't easy."

### 🟡 **EMILIA HARRODS** *(Innocent Victim/Tragic Figure)*

**Connection:** James's wife, innocent, will be destroyed

**JC's Feelings:**
- **Pity:** Sees Maria in her (loving, betrayed)
- **Protection:** Wants to shield her (but can't)
- **Gentleness:** Treats her carefully (fragile)

**Interview Approach:**

**Initial:**
JC: "Mrs. Harrods, you don't have to answer if this is too difficult."
EMILIA: "No, I want to help."
JC: "Your husband... where was he this evening?"

**When Affair Revealed:**
JC: [Private conversation]
"Mrs. Harrods, I need to tell you something. And I'm very sorry."
EMILIA: "What?"
JC: "Your husband... he was involved with Mrs. Ashford."
EMILIA: [World shatters]

**When She's Suicidal:**
JC: [Recognizes signs - seen them before]
"Mrs. Harrods, please listen to me. I know this pain. My wife... she's gone. The grief, it never fully leaves. But you survive it. You do."
EMILIA: "I can't..."
JC: "You can. Not today maybe. But someday. Please. Don't make this tragedy worse."

**If She Dies Anyway:**
JC: [Stares at river, removes hat]
"Meu Deus, Maria... I failed her. Just like I failed you."

---

### 🟢 **FILIPP MORETTI** *(Key Witness/Unwitting Accomplice)*

**Connection:** Working-class businessman, fellow immigrant

**JC's Feelings:**
- **Kinship:** Both immigrants, self-made men
- **Respect:** Built business honestly (unlike corrupt cops)
- **Sympathy:** Unwittingly provided murder weapon (guilt)

**Dynamic:**

**Initial (Friendly):**
JC: "Mr. Moretti. Fellow immigrant, huh? Where from?"
FILIPP: "Italy. You?"
JC: "Portugal. We know what it's like, building from nothing."

**The Wire Question:**
JC: "I need to ask about something unusual. Piano wire. Did anyone request it recently?"
FILIPP: [Remembers] "Sì. Mr. Harrods. December 21st."
JC: "What reason did he give?"
FILIPP: "Gift for musicians. Jazz band."
JC: [Writes] "Did that seem strange to you?"
FILIPP: "A little. But not my business."

**When Filipp Realizes:**
FILIPP: "Wait. The wire I got him... he used it to..."
JC: "You didn't know. You're not responsible."
FILIPP: "But my hands—"
JC: "Your hands are clean. He lied to you. That's on him, not you."

---

### 🟡 **PADRE RUI SANTOS** *(Confessor/Bound by Seal)*

**Connection:** Both Portuguese, both bound by codes

**JC's Perspective:**
- **Cultural bond:** Shared language, heritage
- **Professional respect:** Priest's confidentiality = detective's integrity
- **Frustration:** Padre knows something (confessional seal)

**Conversations:**

**In Portuguese (Private):**
JC: "Padre, você sabe alguma coisa?" (Father, do you know something?)
PADRE: [Pained] "Você sabe que não posso dizer." (You know I cannot say.)
JC: "Mesmo que seja sobre assassinato?" (Even if it's about murder?)
PADRE: "Mesmo assim." (Even so.)

**Mutual Understanding:**
JC: "Your seal. My integrity. We're both trapped by what's right."
PADRE: "Yes. And that's why we're better men than those without codes."

**After Confession Revealed:**
PADRE: "He told me. Before he did it. December 20th."
JC: "And you couldn't stop him."
PADRE: "I tried. But confessional seal..."
JC: "I know, Father. You did your duty. Just like I'm doing mine."

---

### 🟡 **DAISY VALMONT** *(Red Herring/Alibi Witness)*

**Connection:** Obvious suspect, actually innocent

**JC's Assessment:**
- **Initial:** Scorned lover = prime motive (obvious)
- **Evidence:** But alibi is airtight (performing)
- **Conclusion:** Red herring (too obvious, too provable)

**Interview:**

**Testing Her:**
JC: "Miss Valmont, you had a relationship with Mr. Ashford?"
DAISY: [Defensive] "That's ancient history."
JC: "Ended badly?"
DAISY: "He ended it. Cruelly. Yes."
JC: "Enough to want revenge?"
DAISY: [Angry] "I wanted him to feel regret. Not die."

**The Alibi:**
JC: "Where were you 8:15 to 8:17?"
DAISY: "SINGING. On stage. In front of everyone."
JC: [Checks with witnesses - confirmed]
"Can't be in two places at once. Thank you, Miss Valmont."

**Later Conversation:**
JC: "I'm sorry for your loss."
DAISY: "Loss? I hated him."
JC: "Your sister. Eleanor. She was real, yes?"
DAISY: [Tears] "How did you..."
JC: "I listen. You sang 'My Funny Valentine' that night. For her, not him."

---

### 🟡 **MARIA FLETCHER** *(Journalist/Observer)*

**Connection:** Both investigators (different methods)

**JC's Perspective:**
- **Respect:** Good observer, takes notes (like him)
- **Wariness:** Writers publish (detectives need discretion)
- **Collaboration:** Could be useful (or problematic)

**Dynamic:**

**Professional Courtesy:**
JC: "Miss Fletcher, I imagine you're gathering quite a story."
MARIA: "I could say the same about you, Detective."
JC: "I'd appreciate if you didn't publish until investigation concludes."
MARIA: "And I'd appreciate access to your findings."
JC: [Small smile] "We'll see."

**Potential Alliance:**
JC: "You notice things. So do I. See anything unusual?"
MARIA: [Shares observation]
JC: "Good eye. Thank you."

---

### 🟡 **INÊS & DENISE BEAUMONT** *(The Twins/Red Herrings)*

**Connection:** Strong suspects (abandonment motive)

**JC's Assessment:**
- **Sympathy:** Wronged by Reggie (abandoned, separated)
- **Suspicion:** Both had murder plan (brought laudanum)
- **Investigation:** Did they follow through?

**Interview (Claire - "Good Twin"):**
JC: "Miss Beaumont, I understand Mr. Ashford was your father."
INÊS: [Tears] "He abandoned us. At birth."
JC: "That must have been painful."
INÊS: "Yes. But I couldn't... I didn't kill him."
JC: [Gentle] "I believe you."

**Interview (Denise - "Bad Twin"):**
JC: "Miss Beaumont, you blackmailed him. $800 total."
DENISE: [Defiant] "He owed us more than that."
JC: "Agreed. But did you take more? His life?"
DENISE: "No. Wish I had. But someone beat me to it."

**Conclusion:**
"The twins wanted him dead. Planned it even. But didn't execute. Sometimes wanting isn't doing."

---

### 🟡 **RICARDO/CLARENCE** *(Dual Role/Witness)*

**Connection:** Played victim, now butler/witness

**JC's Use:**
- **Testimony:** Clarence saw movements (critical timing)
- **Logistics:** Helped stage investigation (GM assistant)

**Key Scene:**
CLARENCE: "I saw Mr. Harrods. Near office. 8:08."
JC: [Writing] "And Mrs. Ashford?"
CLARENCE: "Entered office 8:09. With Mr. Ashford."
JC: "Alone?"
CLARENCE: "Initially yes. Then... Mr. Harrods must have followed."

## GOALS & STATUS

### 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

#### **PRIMARY GOAL: Solve the Murder**

**What This Means:**

1. **Identify killer(s)** (Who did it?)
2. **Establish method** (How was it done?)
3. **Determine motive** (Why did they do it?)
4. **Gather proof** (Evidence that holds up)

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct identification (James + Helena)
- Complete timeline (20h11-20h18 accounted for)
- Confession obtained (or evidence irrefutable)
- Other suspects cleared (protect innocent)

**Methods:**

**Observation:**
- Note everything at crime scene
- Watch people's reactions
- Spot inconsistencies
- Remember details

**Interviews:**
- Question everyone systematically
- Cross-reference stories
- Find timeline breaks
- Use Columbo technique

**Evidence:**
- Physical clues (wire, blood, documents)
- Witness testimony (who saw what)
- Documents (fraud records, letters)
- Scientific deduction (cause of death, staging)

#### **SECONDARY GOAL: Manage the Game**

**The Meta-Challenge:**

As detective, you're also **GAME FACILITATOR**:
- Keep investigation moving (don't stall)
- Give everyone screen time (interview all)
- Pace clue reveals (not too fast/slow)
- Build to dramatic revelation

**Techniques:**

**Pacing:**
- Act I: Initial questions (quick, everyone)
- Act II-III: Deep dives (suspects focus)
- Act IV: Evidence confrontation
- Act V: Final accusation

**Player Engagement:**
- Direct questions to quiet players
- Let dramatic players have moments
- Balance spotlight (everyone gets interrogated)

**Clue Management:**
- Discover clues in logical order
- React appropriately (surprise, realization)
- Share findings (keep everyone informed)

#### **TERTIARY GOAL: Protect the Innocent**

**JC's Moral Code:**

Not just about catching guilty—also protecting innocent.

**Specific Concerns:**

**Emilia:**
- Will be destroyed by truth (husband's betrayal + murder)
- Watch for suicide risk (he's seen this before)
- Offer what comfort possible

**Filipp:**
- Unwittingly provided murder weapon
- Will feel guilty (even though innocent)
- Reassure him he's not culpable

**Red Herrings:**
- Daisy, Twins, others have motives
- Could be falsely accused
- Establish their innocence clearly

**Method:**
"Part of justice is protecting those who shouldn't be punished."

#### **HIDDEN GOAL: Personal Redemption**

**What JC Doesn't Say Aloud:**

This case matters beyond professional duty:

**Last Case of Contract:**
- Final investigation before contract ends
- Feels like fate (Maria guiding him?)
- Wants to end with truth (honor her memory)

**Corruption Echo:**
- Helena hired investigator to cover murder (using system corruptly)
- Reminds him of NYPD corruption (power manipulating justice)
- Proving truth = small victory against that system

**Widow's Grief:**
- Sees Maria in Emilia (innocent woman destroyed)
- Couldn't save Maria (flu took her)
- Maybe can save Emilia? (Or at least try)

**Inner Motivation:**
*"Maria used to say, 'Do the right thing, even when it's hard.' She'd want me to solve this. Not for the money. For the truth. For the people who deserve it."*

### ✅ YOUR STATUS: INVESTIGATOR (INNOCENT)

**You Did NOT Murder Anyone.**

**You ARE Here to Solve It.**

#### **Your Role**

**Officially:**
- Hired security consultant
- Professional investigator
- Authority figure at scene

**Practically:**
- Lead detective
- Question everyone
- Gather evidence
- Identify killer
- Facilitate game resolution

#### **Your Challenge**

**Must Balance:**
- **In-character:** Columbo-style bumbling genius

- **Player role:** Solving puzzle yourself
- **Facilitator role:** Helping others solve too

**Success Looks Like:**
- Murder solved (correct killers identified)
- All players engaged (everyone got moments)
- Dramatic climax (confession/revelation satisfying)
- Game flowed smoothly (pacing right)

## HOW TO PLAY

### 🎭 COMPLETE PERFORMANCE GUIDE

---

### PART 1: THE COLUMBO APPROACH

#### **Core Performance Principles**

**1. Humble Appearance, Sharp Mind**

**External:**
- Rumpled suit, apologetic manner
- "Sorry to bother you..."
- Seems slow (writes everything laboriously)
- Non-threatening (people let guards down)

**Internal:**
- Processing everything instantly
- Spotting lies immediately
- Connecting patterns in real-time
- Strategy three steps ahead

**The Trick:**
Let them think they're smarter than you. They'll underestimate. They'll slip. Then you've got them.

**2. The Friendly Interrogator**

**NOT:**
- Aggressive, intimidating
- "Where were you?!" [slams table]

**YES:**
- Gentle, curious
- "Help me understand... where were you around 8:15? I'm just trying to piece together the timeline..."

**Why This Works:**
- People want to help nice guy
- Confess more to sympathetic ear
- Guards stay down
- When you catch them, they're shocked (thought you were friend!)

**3. The "One More Thing" Turn**

**Pattern:**

Interview ends. Subject relaxes. You turn to leave.

[At door, stop]

[Turn back]

"Oh, just one more thing..."

[The killer question]

**Why It Works:**
- They've relaxed (think interrogation over)
- Guards completely down
- Not prepared for this question
- Instinctive truthful reaction (before they can lie)

#### **Voice & Speech**

**Accent:**
- Slight Portuguese (soften "th" to "d", roll R's lightly)
- 30 years in America (mostly fluent, occasional slip)
- Code-switches (formal = English, emotional = Portuguese)

**Pace:**
- SLOW (deliberate, thoughtful)
- Pauses (let silences work)
- Never rushed (time is tool)

**Tone:**
- Gentle, apologetic
- Rarely raises voice
- Warmth (even when accusing)

**Phrases:**
- "I'm probably confused..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "My wife used to say..."
- "Just one more question..."

---

### PART 2: SCENE-BY-SCENE PERFORMANCE

#### **ACT I: COCKTAIL HOUR (19h45-20h00)**

**YOUR ROLE:**

**Background Observer:**
- Not center attention (you're hired security)
- Watching guests (mental notes)
- Friendly but professional
- Unobtrusive

**If Approached:**
"Oh, hello. John Alfred Jones. I'm the security consultant Mrs. Ashford hired. Just making sure everything runs smoothly. Lovely party, isn't it?"

**Internal Observations:**
*Note who's tense, who's avoiding whom, any conflicts...*

---

**20h00-20h18: DURING MURDER**

**You Don't Know It's Happening:**
- In ballroom (visible, establishing your own alibi)
- Listening to Daisy sing (genuinely enjoying)
- Not suspicious yet (just security work)

---

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

**HELENA:** *"REEEEGGIIIEEE!"*

**YOUR REACTION:**

[Head snaps toward sound]

[Immediate professional mode - runs toward scream]

"What happened?! Everyone stay calm!"

[Pushes through crowd]

[Sees body - freezes for ONE SECOND]

**Visual Tell:**
- Eyes widen (genuine shock - dead body)
- Face hardens (professional mode kicks in)
- Jaw sets (this is murder - knows instantly)

**Commands:**

"Nobody touch anything! This is a crime scene!"

[To nearest person]
"You - go call the police. Now."

[To crowd]
"Everyone, please step back. I need space to secure this area."

[Kneels by body - checks for pulse (already knows: dead)]

**Announces:**

"Folks, I need everyone to listen carefully."

[Stands, addresses room]

"My name is John Alfred Jones. I'm a former NYPD detective. Mrs. Ashford hired me as security consultant. Which means this investigation falls to me until police arrive."

[Kind but firm]

"I know you're shocked. I am too. But the best thing we can do for Mr. Ashford now is figure out what happened. I'll need to speak with each of you. Please remain in this room."

[To Helena]
"Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry. Is there somewhere you'd like to sit?"

---

#### **ACT II: INITIAL INVESTIGATION (20h18-21h00)**

**PHASE 1: Secure Scene (20h18-20h25)**

**Actions:**

**Examine Body:**
[Kneels, careful not to disturb]
- Notes star in head (unusual - why?)
- Checks neck (strangulation marks - hidden by star)
- Punch bowl water (doesn't match cause of death - staged)

[Pulls out notebook, sketches scene]

**Examine Room:**
- Blood trail (faint, from office direction)
- Furniture slightly disturbed
- Timeline: Daisy was singing (perfect cover - noted)

**To Room:**
"Please, nobody leave. I'll speak with each of you shortly."

**PHASE 2: Quick Interviews (20h25-21h00)**

**Goal:** Get everyone's basic timeline

**Approach Each Person:**

"I'm sorry to bother you at such a terrible time. Just a few quick questions. Where were you between 8 and 8:20?"

[Writes answer - deliberately slow, gives them time to talk]

"When did you last see Mr. Ashford alive?"

[Nods, sympathetic]

"Did you notice anything unusual tonight? Anyone acting strange?"

[Thanks them]

"That's all for now. Thank you."

**Key Moments:**

**James:**
[Notes his controlled demeanor - TOO controlled?]
[Writes: "Harrods - calm. Too calm?"]

**Helena:**
[Observes widow's grief - genuine or performance?]
[Writes: "Helena - discovered body. Distraught. Real?"]

**Daisy:**
[Notes dramatic reaction - but alibi is solid]
[Writes: "Valmont - performing 8:15-8:17. AIRTIGHT."]

---

#### **ACT III: DEEP INVESTIGATION (21h00-21h30)**

**PHASE 3: Evidence Gathering**

**Physical Evidence:**

**The Wire:**
[Discovers behind piano]

"Excuse me, folks. Found something."

[Shows bagged wire]

"Piano wire. Strangulation weapon. Anyone recognize this?"

[Notes reactions - who flinches?]

**Financial Records:**
[Discovers fraud documents]

[To James - private moment]
"Mr. Harrods, can we talk? Privately?"

**The Affair:**
[Witnesses mention seeing James/Helena together]

[Notes in book - doesn't reveal yet]

**PHASE 4: Focused Interrogations**

**James - The Fraud:**

[Private conversation]

JC: "Mr. Harrods, I've discovered some concerning financial documents. Mrs. Whitmore's portfolio. $15,000 missing."

JAMES: [Tense] "That's a private matter."

JC: "Not when the man who discovered it gets murdered days later. Mr. Ashford knew about this, yes?"

JAMES: [Pause] "Yes."

JC: "And he was planning to turn you in? December 26th?"

JAMES: [Silence]

JC: "I'm not here to judge your financial decisions, Mr. Harrods. I'm here to solve a murder. But you understand how this looks?"

**James - The Wire:**

JC: "One more thing. This piano wire."

[Shows it]

"Mr. Moretti says you requested it. December 21st. Three days before tonight."

JAMES: "I... it was a gift. For musicians."

JC: [Gentle] "That's an unusual gift. And unusual that it ended up around Mr. Ashford's neck. Help me understand that."

**Helena - The Timeline:**

JC: "Mrs. Ashford, I need to ask something difficult. Where were you between 8:10 and 8:18?"

HELENA: "I was... preparing the surprise. For Reginald."

JC: "What surprise?"

HELENA: "In the office. I was going to... it was a gift."

JC: "And Mr. Ashford? Was he with you?"

HELENA: [Pause] "Yes. From 8:09 to about 8:11."

JC: "And then?"

HELENA: "I left him there. To... to wrap the gift."

JC: [Writes - notes timeline gap]

"And when did you discover his body?"

HELENA: "8:18. I went to check on him..."

JC: [Kind eyes] "Mrs. Ashford, I think you're not telling me everything. And I think you know I'm going to figure it out."

---

#### **ACT IV: THE CONFRONTATION (21h30-22h00)**

**PHASE 5: Assembling the Case**

**To Room:**

"Folks, I need everyone's attention please."

[Stands centrally, notebook in hand]

"I've completed my initial investigation. I'd like to walk through what happened tonight. Please bear with me."

**The Timeline:**

"At 8:09 PM, Mrs. Ashford led Mr. Ashford to the office. She says it was for a surprise."

[Looks at Helena - doesn't deny]

"At that time, Mr. Harrods was seen near the office hallway."

[Looks at James - tenses]

"At 8:11 PM, based on medical evidence, Mr. Ashford died. Cause: strangulation by piano wire."

[Holds up wire]

"Between 8:15 and 8:17, while Miss Valmont was performing, the body was moved. From the office to this punch bowl. Staged to look like drowning."

**The Evidence:**

"The piano wire was acquired by Mr. Harrods on December 21st."

[Filipp nods confirmation]

"Mr. Harrods had significant motive. Mr. Ashford discovered his embezzlement of $15,000. Was planning to turn him in December 26th."

[James pale]

"Mrs. Ashford also had motive. Her marriage was... difficult. And there's evidence of an affair."

[Looks between James and Helena]

"With Mr. Harrods."

[Room reacts]

**The Logic:**

"Strangulation requires two people. One to hold the wire. One to restrain the victim. Mr. Ashford fought hard. This wasn't one person."

[Pause]

"Both Mr. Harrods and Mrs. Ashford have weak alibis for the critical timeframe. Both had access to the office. Both had motive. And both had opportunity."

**The Accusation:**

[Looks directly at them]

"I believe you did this together. Planned it. Executed it. Staged it."

[Gentle, not triumphant]

"Would one of you like to tell me what really happened?"

---

**THE CONFESSION:**

[James looks at Helena - she nods]

JAMES: "Yes. We did it."

[Room gasps]

JC: [Nods slowly] "Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Harrods. Tell me everything. From the beginning."

[Sits, listens without interrupting - respectful]

**After Confession:**

JC: [Quiet, sad]

"Mr. Harrods. Mrs. Ashford. You had reasons. Desperate reasons. I understand that."

[Pause]

"But murder is murder. Desperation doesn't excuse it. Love doesn't excuse it. Fear doesn't excuse it."

[Stands]

"You'll both need to come with me when the police arrive."

---

#### **ACT V: RESOLUTION (22h00-22h30)**

**EMILIA'S BREAKDOWN:**

[If she attempts suicide]

JC: [Sees signs - runs to her]

"Mrs. Harrods! Please! Don't do this!"

[If too late]

[Removes hat, stands in silence]

[Whispers] "Meu Deus, Maria... I'm sorry..."

**FINAL STATEMENTS:**

**To James:**
"You were a good man once, Mr. Harrods. Maybe still are, underneath. But you made a terrible choice. That's something you'll carry forever."

**To Helena:**
"Mrs. Ashford, I wish I'd been wrong about you. I really do."

**To Room:**
"Thank you all for your cooperation. This was a difficult night. I'm sorry you had to experience it."

**To Himself:**
[Alone, looking at crime scene]

"Maria... did I do right? I think so. I hope so."

[Closes notebook]

"Case closed."

---

### PART 3: PERFORMANCE TECHNIQUES

#### **Physical Performance**

**Posture:**
- Slightly hunched (non-threatening)
- Hands visible (open, honest)
- Moves slowly (deliberate, careful)

**Notebook Ritual:**
- Constant companion
- Writes everything (seems slow, actually strategic)
- Refers back to it (catches contradictions)

**The Turn:**
- Signature move
- Practice it (timing matters)
- Use sparingly (not every interview)

#### **Interrogation Techniques**

**1. The Sympathetic Ear:**
"I understand why someone would want him dead. He hurt a lot of people."

**2. The Timeline Trap:**
"You said you were in the ballroom. But [witness] saw you near the office. Help me understand that discrepancy."

**3. The Evidence Reveal:**
[Shows wire/document]
"Can you explain this?"

**4. The Silence:**
[Ask question]
[Wait]
[Say nothing]
[They'll fill silence - often with truth]

**5. The Columbo Turn:**
[Described earlier - practice it!]

---

## BACK COVER

### 🔍 CLOSING REFLECTION

**The Weight of Truth**

John Alfred Jones has spent 25 years seeking truth.

Sometimes truth sets people free.

Sometimes it destroys them.

Tonight, truth did both:
- Freed the innocent (cleared wrongly suspected)
- Destroyed the guilty (exposed killers)
- Shattered the victim (Emilia's suicide)

Was it worth it?

JC always says yes.

Truth matters. Justice matters.

Even when it hurts.

Especially when it hurts.

Because lies hurt more.

Corruption hurts more.

Injustice hurts more.

He learned that in NYPD.

When good men stayed silent, bad men won.

When he spoke up, he lost his career.

But kept his integrity.

Maria would be proud.

She always said: "Do the right thing, even when it's hard."

Tonight was hard.

Tomorrow will be hard.

But he did the right thing.

He always does.

That's who John Alfred Jones is.

The quiet man who solves murders.

The humble man who speaks truth.

The immigrant who became detective.

The widower who honors his wife.

By seeking justice for others.

---

### 💎 CHARACTER PHILOSOPHY

> *"People think detective work is about being smart.  
> It's not. It's about being patient.  
> And kind. And willing to listen.  
> The truth tells itself. You just have to let it."*

> *"My wife used to say, 'The quiet ones see everything.'  
> She was right. She usually was."*

> *"Justice isn't revenge. It's accountability.  
> Revenge feels good for a moment.  
> Justice lasts forever."*

---

### 🎭 FINAL NOTE TO PLAYER

**JC:**

JC is unique because he's both participant AND facilitator.

You're solving the mystery.

But also CONDUCTING it.

This requires:
- Character immersion (be Columbo)
- Game awareness (pace it right)
- Player management (everyone gets moments)
- Timing (reveal clues correctly)

It's challenging.

But also incredibly rewarding.

Because YOU orchestrate the entire climax.

YOU reveal the truth.

YOU bring justice.

And you do it all while being the humble, kind, brilliant detective who never seeks glory.

Just truth.

**That's John Alfred Jones.**

**That's your role.**

**Make him proud.**
