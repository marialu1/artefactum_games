**Player Name:** Cris (Cristina)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You are Emília Harrods, a gentle soul caught in a web of betrayal you don't yet understand. Once known as Sister Cristina, you left the convent eight years ago for love—a decision that cost you your vows but gave you James, the man you adore with your whole heart. You are a genuine believer in the spiritual realm, conducting séances not as parlor tricks but as sacred communion with the departed. Tonight, you will lead two séances to contact Reggie's spirit, unaware that the shadows in this mansion hide a truth that will shatter your world: your husband and your hostess are lovers, and they killed together. When you discover this in Act IV, your faith, your marriage, and your reason to live will crumble. Your story ends not with accusation but with a silent exit—a suicide note, a closed door, and a grief too profound for words.

**Core Tragedy:** You are the only truly innocent soul in this room, and you will pay the highest price.

**Nationality:** Portuguese-American  
**Residence:** Upper West Side, Manhattan (shared with James)  
**Marital Status:** Married to James Harrods (1920)

### Professional Life
**Current Occupation:** Private spiritualist and medium  
**Services Offered:**
- Séances for bereaved families
- Spiritual counseling
- Communication with the departed
- Blessing ceremonies

**Reputation:** Known in certain circles as genuine (not a charlatan). You refuse payment from those who cannot afford it. Your faith is real.

**Previous Life (1910-1918):**
- Entered Convent Santa Clara at age 20
- Known as Sister Cristina
- Devoted to prayer, contemplation, and service

### Connection to Tonight's Party
**Official Invitation:** Helena invited you and James as a married couple. Reggie was polite but distant toward you. You didn't know him well, but you felt his darkness—something cold behind the charm.

**Why You're Really Here:** Helena wants the appearance of normalcy. She and James are lovers, and having you present (the innocent wife) provides perfect cover. You don't know this yet.

**Your Understanding:** You think Helena invited you out of social courtesy. You're grateful—James's banking connections are important, and you want to support him.

## II. PERSONALITY & BACKGROUND

### Personality Traits

**Core Characteristics:**
1. **Genuinely Spiritual:** Your faith is real. You believe the veil between worlds is thin, that spirits linger, that love transcends death.
2. **Gentle & Compassionate:** You see suffering in others and want to help. This makes you vulnerable.
3. **Devoted Wife:** You love James with a quiet, complete devotion. He is your anchor after leaving the church.
4. **Quietly Strong:** You gave up everything for love. That takes courage, even if others don't see it.
5. **Naive to Betrayal:** You trust James absolutely. The idea that he could betray you is unthinkable.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speak softly, with a slight Portuguese lilt
- Touch your rosary beads (you still carry them, though you're no longer a nun)
- Close your eyes when "listening" to spirits
- Gentle hand gestures when blessing or comforting

**Signature Phrases:**
- "I sense a presence..."
- "The spirits are restless tonight..."
- "May God have mercy on their souls..."
- "Love never dies, it only transforms..."

### Background Story

**Early Life (1890-1910):**
Born in Porto, Portugal. Raised in devout Catholic family. Always felt called to spiritual life. Immigrated to America at age 18 with family.

**Convent Years (1910-1918):**
- Entered Convent Santa Clara at 20
- Known as Sister Cristina
- Devoted to contemplative prayer
- **1918 Crisis:** Met James Harrods through church charity work. Fell in love. Agonized for months. Chose love over vows.
- Left convent—an act that brought shame to her family and broke her own heart

**Life with James (1920-Present):**
- Married 1920 (small ceremony, her family did not attend)
- Two children born
- Found new purpose in spiritualism (a way to stay connected to the divine outside church structure)
- Believes James is devoted to her (he seems distracted lately, but she assumes it's work stress)

## III. PUBLIC SECRET
*(This is information others know or might know about you)*

### Your Ex-Nun Past

**What People Know:**
- You were Sister Cristina at Convent Santa Clara (1910-1918)
- You left the convent to marry James
- This was scandalous in certain circles
- Your family was deeply hurt

**What People Might Whisper:**
- "She broke her vows for a man"
- "Can you trust someone who abandoned God?"
- "Once a nun, always a nun—what is she really?"

**Your Response (if asked):**
> "Yes, I was Sister Cristina. I left because I believed God wanted me to serve Him differently—through love, through family, through helping lost souls find peace. It was the hardest decision of my life, but I don't regret it. James showed me that love is also sacred."

**Who Knows:**
- **Father Juan Carlos** knows you intimately from those days (you were in the same diocese). He will recognize your voice during the séance. This will create tension.
- **Helena** knows vaguely (James mentioned it)
- **Others** might know through social gossip

---

## IV. PRIVATE SECRETS
*(Information ONLY you know—do NOT reveal unless strategically necessary)*

### Secret #1: You Still Pray to the Virgin Mary

**The Secret:**  
Despite leaving the convent, you never left your faith. Every night, you pray the rosary. You light candles to the Virgin Mary. You attend Mass when James isn't looking (he finds it "excessive"). You are still, in your heart, a nun who chose love—but the spiritual wound never healed.

**Why It's Secret:**  
James thinks you've "moved on" from that life. If he knew how deeply you still cling to it, he might question your commitment to your marriage. You don't want him to think you regret choosing him.

**If Discovered:**  
Someone might find your hidden rosary or see you crossing yourself. You can say: *"Old habits. They bring me comfort."*

---

### Secret #2: You Know Reggie Was Evil

**The Secret:**  
During a charity event six months ago, you briefly touched Reggie's hand. You felt something—a darkness, a coldness. In your spiritual belief system, this was a sign. You believe Reggie had sold his soul or harbored deep evil. You've been uneasy around him ever since but said nothing (it would sound insane).

**Why It's Secret:**  
Saying "I felt evil in him" makes you sound like a superstitious hysteric. James already worries people think you're "too mystical." You kept it to yourself.

**If Discovered:**  
If someone asks why you seem unsurprised Reggie is dead, you might hint: *"I'm a medium. Sometimes I sense when someone is... marked."*

**Strategic Use:**  
This can be used to deflect suspicion OR to seem mysteriously knowing.

---

### Secret #3: You've Felt James Pulling Away

**The Secret:**  
For the past year, James has been distant. Fewer embraces. Late nights "at the bank." Distracted during dinner. You've told yourself it's work stress, but deep down, a quiet voice whispers: *He doesn't love you anymore.*

You've been terrified to confront this because if you lost James, you'd have nothing—no convent, no family (they disowned you), no identity. So you smile, you pray, you pretend everything is fine.

**Why It's Secret:**  
Admitting this would mean admitting your worst fear. You're in denial.

**The Truth You Don't Know (Yet):**  
James is having an affair with Helena. They are lovers. They killed Reggie together so they could be free. In Act IV, you will discover this. It will destroy you.

**When You Discover (Act IV, ~22h30):**  
You will find evidence (GM will provide—perhaps a love letter, or overhearing a confession, or putting pieces together). Your world will collapse. You will write a suicide note and exit the game. This is your tragic end.

---

### Secret #4: You Recognize Father Juan Carlos's Voice (And He Recognizes Yours)

**The Secret:**  
You and Father Juan Carlos were in the same diocese during your convent years. He knew you as Sister Cristina. You haven't seen him in years, but during the séance, when you speak in your "spirit voice," he will recognize you. And you will recognize his voice when he speaks.

This creates a loaded, unspoken tension: *He knows who you were. He knows you left. He probably judged you.*

**Why It's Secret:**  
You don't want to address your past in front of James or strangers. It's painful. If Father Juan Carlos confronts you privately, you might say: *"Yes, Father. I remember you. Please don't—I can't go back."*

**Strategic Use:**  
This connection can add dramatic tension. Father Juan Carlos might feel protective of you (he knew you as innocent). When you die, his grief will be profound.

---

## V. GOALS & STATUS

### Your Goals Tonight

1. **Support James:** Be a good wife. Make him proud. Help him network with important people.
2. **Conduct Séances:** Helena asked you to lead two séances to "contact Reggie." You take this seriously—it's spiritual work.
3. **Stay Unnoticed:** You're not comfortable in high society. You'd rather fade into the background.
4. **Maintain Faith:** Even in this dark moment, trust that God has a plan.

### Your Innocence

**Did You Kill Reggie?**  
**NO.** You are completely innocent. You had no motive, no knowledge of the plot, no involvement. 

You are the ONLY truly innocent person at this party (besides the detective). Everyone else has secrets, lies, motives. You are simply a woman who loved too much and will pay the ultimate price.

---

### Your Fate (Act IV - Suicide)

**Timing:** Act IV (~22h30, approximately 80-90 minutes into game)

**What Happens:**  
During the investigation's peak, you will discover irrefutable evidence that James and Helena are lovers and co-conspirators in Reggie's murder. The GM will provide this moment (examples: love letter, overheard confession, puzzle pieces suddenly clicking).

**Your Reaction:**  
1. **Silent Realization:** You don't scream. You don't accuse. You simply... understand. Everything makes sense now. The distance. The late nights. The way they look at each other.

2. **Emotional Collapse:** You excuse yourself quietly ("I need air"). You go to a private room (conservatory, study—GM will guide).

3. **Suicide Note:** You write a brief note. Examples:
   > *"I loved him more than my vows, more than my soul. He loved another. There is nothing left. Forgive me, God. — Cristina"*

   Or:

   > *"To those who find this: My husband killed for love—but not love of me. I cannot bear this world without faith, without him, without truth. I go to ask God why He let me leave the convent for this. — E.C.H."*

4. **Exit:** You leave the note somewhere visible. You exit the game. The GM will announce your death shortly after.

**For Player (Cris):**  
This is an emotional, heavy moment. The GM will check in with you beforehand to ensure you're comfortable. After your exit, you become an observer—you can watch the rest of the game unfold, knowing your death adds weight to the tragedy.

**Impact on Game:**  
Your suicide shocks everyone. It confirms James and Helena's guilt (why else would you kill yourself?). It adds a layer of profound tragedy. Even the detective will feel this loss.

## VI. HOW TO PLAY

### Character Energy
- **Tone:** Gentle, spiritual, quietly sad
- **Physicality:** Soft movements, hands often clasped or touching rosary
- **Voice:** Calm, with occasional Portuguese words slipping in when emotional

### Key Performance Notes

**During Séances (Act III - Lead Two Séances):**
1. **Setup:** Everyone holds hands around the table. Candles lit. You close your eyes.
2. **Invocation:** 
   > *"Spirits of the departed, we call upon you. Reginald Ashford, if you linger in this realm, speak through me. Show us the truth..."*

3. **"Spirit Voice":** Speak in a slightly different tone (raspy, older). Say cryptic things the GM whispers to you (clues about the murder).

4. **Father Juan Carlos's Recognition:** During séance, he will stare at you. You will feel his recognition. Acknowledge it subtly (a flicker of eye contact).

**Interactions:**

- **With James:** Loving, supportive. You touch his arm, smile at him. You have NO IDEA he's betraying you.
- **With Helena:** Polite, warm. You think she's kind for inviting you. You see no threat.
- **With Father Juan Carlos:** Tense. Avoid eye contact. If he approaches privately, you might say: *"Please, Father. I made my choice. Don't make me defend it again."*
- **With Others:** Gentle. If someone is upset, you offer comfort. You're a natural healer.

**When Accused (if it happens):**  
You're genuinely confused. You can say: *"I had no reason to harm Reggie. I barely knew him. I'm only here to support my husband."*

**Act IV (The Discovery):**  
The GM will signal you. You'll find the evidence. Your face goes blank. You excuse yourself quietly. You exit. This is your final scene.

---

### Special Abilities

**Séance Leader:** You control the mood during séances. Use this to create atmosphere, reveal clues (GM provides), and add mystical tension.

**Spiritual Intuition:** You can "sense" things about people. Use this to comment on tensions, darkness, or hidden truths (even if you don't know specifics).

**Rosary Comfort:** If someone is distraught, offer to pray with them. This creates intimate, vulnerable moments.

---

## VII. RELATIONSHIPS

### James Harrods (Husband / Betrayer)

**Public Dynamic:** Loving wife and supportive husband. You're proud of him. He's protective of you.

**Private Truth:** He's been having an affair with Helena for over a year. He co-planned and executed Reggie's murder with her. You don't know this until Act IV.

**Your Feelings:** Deep, unconditional love. You gave up your vows for him. He is your entire world.

**His Feelings (Unknown to You):** Guilt. He does care for you (you're the mother of his children), but he's in love with Helena. He wishes you didn't exist—not maliciously, but because you're in the way.

**Key Moments:**
- Early game: Touch his hand, smile at him, defend him if questioned
- Act IV: Discover his affair, realize he killed, write suicide note

---

### Helena Ashford (Hostess / Secret Rival)

**Public Dynamic:** Polite acquaintances. You're grateful she invited you. She seems kind.

**Private Truth:** She's your husband's lover. She killed her husband with your husband. She pities you but also sees you as an obstacle.

**Your Feelings:** Warm, unsuspecting. You might even feel a bit sorry for her (widowed so suddenly).

**Her Feelings (Unknown to You):** Guilt. She knows you're innocent. When you die, she'll feel responsible.

**Key Moments:**
- Early game: Thank her for the invitation, offer to conduct séances
- Act IV: Realize she stole your husband, exit in silence

---

### Father Juan Carlos (Former Confessor / Witness)

**Public Dynamic:** You recognize him but try to avoid deep conversation.

**Private Truth:** He knew you as Sister Cristina. He tried to convince you not to leave the convent. He sees your choice as tragic.

**Your Feelings:** Shame, defensiveness, residual respect. He represents the life you abandoned.

**His Feelings:** Complicated. He remembers you as devout. He sees your current pain. When you die, he'll be devastated (he saw this coming).

**Key Moments:**
- During séance: He recognizes your voice. You lock eyes briefly.
- If confronted: *"I chose love, Father. I thought it was God's will. Was I wrong?"*
- After your death: He might read your suicide note aloud or pray over you

---

### Others

**John Alfred Jones (Detective):** You're polite. If he questions you, you're honest (you have nothing to hide). You might offer spiritual insight.

**Daisy, Maria, Filipp, Others:** You're kind to everyone. You don't gossip. You notice their pain and might offer comfort.

**Reggie (Victim):** You felt darkness in him months ago. You weren't surprised he died, but you pray for his soul anyway.

---

## VIII. SENSITIVE PLAYER GUIDANCE

### About the Suicide Scene

**This is a heavy role.** Your character dies by suicide in Act IV. This is not meant to be graphic or sensationalized—it's a tragic, quiet exit that underscores the cost of betrayal.

**Before Game Night:**
- The GM will discuss this scene with you in advance
- You can opt out if uncomfortable (GM will adjust the story)
- You are in control of how much emotion to show

**During the Scene:**
- Keep it understated: quiet realization, a note, an exit
- Don't feel you must "perform" anguish—sometimes silence is more powerful
- The GM will handle the announcement of your death

**After Your Exit:**
- You become an observer—watch the rest unfold
- Your death will weigh heavily on James and Helena
- The other players will feel the tragedy

**Debrief:**
- After the game, the GM will check in with all players, especially you
- This is fiction, and everyone should feel safe

---

## IX. COSTUME & PROPS SUGGESTIONS

**Costume:**
- 1920s modest dress (darker colors—deep blue, burgundy, black)
- Long sleeves, high neck (reflecting your former nun modesty)
- Rosary beads (hidden in pocket or worn as bracelet)
- Simple cross necklace
- Hair pinned back neatly

**Props:**
- Rosary beads
- Small prayer book
- Matches (for lighting séance candles)
- Handkerchief (for wiping tears or nervous hands)

**Séance Setup (if you're helping GM):**
- Candles, dim lighting
- A small bell (to signal spirit presence)
- Incense or sage (optional atmosphere)

---

## X. FINAL NOTES

You are Emília—a woman who gave up heaven for love, only to discover that love was a lie. Your tragedy is that you are too good for this world, too trusting, too devoted. When you discover the truth, you won't rage or accuse. You'll simply realize that you've lost everything: your vows, your husband, your reason for living.

Your death is the moral center of this story. It shows that evil doesn't just destroy its targets—it destroys the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.

**Play her with grace, with faith, and with heartbreak.**

When the moment comes, trust the GM. Trust yourself. And trust that your exit will resonate long after the game ends.

---

**Character Status:** ⚠️ SUICIDE VICTIM (Act IV)  
**Player:** Cris  
**Prepared:** Ready for game night

*May God have mercy on us all.*
