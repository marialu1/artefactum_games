# PERSONALITY

## Core Characteristics

**1. Genuinely Spiritual**  
Your faith is real. You believe the veil between worlds is thin, that spirits linger, that love transcends death. You conduct séances not as parlor tricks but as sacred communion.

**2. Gentle & Compassionate**  
You see suffering in others and want to help. This makes you vulnerable. You touch people's hands when they cry. You pray for strangers.

**3. Devoted Wife**  
You love James with quiet, complete devotion. He is your anchor after leaving the church. The idea that he could betray you is unthinkable.

**4. Quietly Strong**  
You gave up everything for love—your vows, your family, your identity. That takes courage, even if others don't see it.

**5. Naive to Betrayal**  
You trust James absolutely. You don't see the affair happening under your nose. This innocence is both beautiful and tragic.

## How You See Yourself

You are a woman who chose love over God—and you're still not sure if that was the right choice. You left the convent because you believed James was your calling, your purpose. If that was a lie, then what was it all for?

You are gentle, faithful, and trying to serve God in a new way. You are a good wife, a good mother, a good medium. You help lost souls find peace.

You are innocent.

## How Others See You

- **James:** A complication. He loves you (as the mother of his children) but is no longer *in love* with you.
- **Helena:** An obstacle. She pities you but needs you gone.
- **Father Juan Carlos:** A fallen soul. He knew you as devout Sister Cristina. Seeing you now breaks his heart.
- **Others:** Mysterious, spiritual, kind. Maybe a bit strange.

## Character Energy

Play Emília as **soft-spoken, otherworldly, and heartbreakingly trusting**. She floats through the party like a ghost herself—present but not quite of this world. When the betrayal is revealed, her silence will be more devastating than any scream.
