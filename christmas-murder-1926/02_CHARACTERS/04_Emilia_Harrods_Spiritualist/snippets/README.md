## Character Essence

Emília is the only truly innocent soul at this party—and she will pay the highest price. Once Sister Cristina, she left the convent for love, only to discover that love was a lie. When she learns her husband James and hostess Helena are lovers who killed together, she will write a suicide note and quietly exit the game.

**Play her with grace, with faith, and with heartbreak.**
