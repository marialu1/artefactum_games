# RELATIONSHIPS

## James Harrods (Husband / Betrayer)

**Public Dynamic:** Loving wife and supportive husband. You're proud of him. He's protective of you.

**Private Truth:** He's been having an affair with Helena for over a year. He co-planned and executed Reggie's murder with her. You don't know this until Act IV.

**Your Feelings:** Deep, unconditional love. You gave up your vows for him. He is your entire world.

**His Feelings (Unknown to You):** Guilt. He does care for you (you're the mother of his children), but he's in love with Helena. He wishes you didn't exist—not maliciously, but because you're in the way.

**Key Moments:**
- Early game: Touch his hand, smile at him, defend him if questioned
- Act IV: Discover his affair, realize he killed, write suicide note

**How to Play:**
- Be affectionate but not clingy
- Defend him fiercely: *"James would never hurt anyone"*
- When the truth comes out, your world ends

## Helena Ashford (Hostess / Secret Rival)

**Public Dynamic:** Polite acquaintances. You're grateful she invited you. She seems kind.

**Private Truth:** She's your husband's lover. She killed her husband with your husband. She pities you but also sees you as an obstacle.

**Your Feelings:** Warm, unsuspecting. You might even feel a bit sorry for her (widowed so suddenly).

**Her Feelings (Unknown to You):** Guilt. She knows you're innocent. When you die, she'll feel responsible.

**Key Moments:**
- Early game: Thank her for the invitation, offer to conduct séances
- Act IV: Realize she stole your husband, exit in silence

**How to Play:**
- Be gracious: *"Thank you so much for inviting us, Helena"*
- Offer spiritual help: *"Would you like me to try to contact Reggie?"*
- No suspicion whatsoever

## Father Juan Carlos (Former Confessor / Witness)

**Public Dynamic:** You recognize him but try to avoid deep conversation.

**Private Truth:** He knew you as Sister Cristina. He tried to convince you not to leave the convent. He sees your choice as tragic.

**Your Feelings:** Shame, defensiveness, residual respect. He represents the life you abandoned.

**His Feelings:** Complicated. He remembers you as devout. He sees your current pain. When you die, he'll be devastated (he saw this coming).

**Key Moments:**
- During séance: He recognizes your voice. You lock eyes briefly.
- If confronted: *"I chose love, Father. I thought it was God's will. Was I wrong?"*
- After your death: He might read your suicide note aloud or pray over you

**How to Play:**
- Avoid eye contact at first
- If he approaches: defensive but respectful
- The shared history adds tension

## Reggie Ashford (Victim)

**Your Connection:** You felt spiritual darkness in him months ago when you touched his hand at a charity event.

**Your Feelings:** Unease. You believed he harbored deep evil. You weren't surprised when he died (though you'd never say this openly).

**How to Play:**
- If asked about him: *"I didn't know him well. But I sensed... something cold."*
- You pray for his soul despite sensing his darkness

## John Alfred Jones (Detective)

**Your Dynamic:** Polite cooperation.

**How to Play:**
- Answer his questions honestly (you have nothing to hide)
- Offer spiritual insight if appropriate: *"I sense much guilt in this room..."*
- You're not a suspect—you're clearly innocent

---

## Others (Daisy, Maria, Filipp, etc.)

**General Approach:**
- Kind to everyone
- Don't gossip
- Notice their pain, offer comfort
- Be the gentle, spiritual presence

**Examples:**
- To someone upset: *"Would you like me to pray with you?"*
- To someone angry: *"Violence only breeds more violence. Let God judge."*

---

## Summary

You are kind to everyone because you genuinely care about people. You defend James because you love him. You respect Father Juan Carlos even though he makes you uncomfortable. You suspect no one—not even the killers who will destroy you.

**Your innocence is absolute. And it will be your undoing.**
