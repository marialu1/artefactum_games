## Key Performance Notes

### During Séances (Act III - You Lead Two Séances)

**Setup:**
1. Everyone holds hands around the table
2. Candles lit, lights dimmed
3. You close your eyes

**Invocation:**
> *"Spirits of the departed, we call upon you. Reginald Ashford, if you linger in this realm, speak through me. Show us the truth..."*

**"Spirit Voice":**
- Speak in a slightly different tone (raspy, older, cryptic)
- The GM will whisper clues to you—repeat them as "Reggie's voice"
- Examples: *"Betrayal... love turned to poison... they thought I didn't know..."*

**Father Juan Carlos's Recognition:**
During the séance, Father Juan Carlos will stare at you. He recognizes your voice from your Sister Cristina days. Lock eyes with him briefly, then look away. This silent moment is powerful.

### Interactions by Character

**With James:**
- Loving, supportive
- Touch his arm, smile at him
- Defend him if questioned: *"James would never hurt anyone. He's a good man."*
- You have NO IDEA he's betraying you

**With Helena:**
- Polite, warm, grateful
- Thank her for the invitation
- Offer to conduct séances
- You see no threat—she's just a gracious hostess

**With Father Juan Carlos:**
- Tense, avoid eye contact
- If he approaches privately: *"Please, Father. I made my choice. Don't make me defend it again."*
- You're ashamed of leaving the convent, worried he judges you

**With Others:**
- Gentle, kind
- If someone is upset, offer comfort: *"Would you like me to pray with you?"*
- You're a natural healer

### When Accused (If It Happens)

You're genuinely confused:
> *"I had no reason to harm Reggie. I barely knew him. I'm only here to support my husband."*

You can add:
> *"I sensed darkness in him once, but I would never... I help souls find peace, I don't send them there."*

### Act IV - The Discovery (Your Exit Scene)

**Timing:** ~22h30 (80-90 minutes into game)

**What Happens:**
1. **GM Signals** - You receive evidence that James and Helena are lovers and killers
2. **Silent Realization** - Your face goes blank. Everything makes sense now.
3. **Quiet Exit** - Stand slowly. Say softly: *"I need air... excuse me..."*
4. **Write Note** - Go to private area (GM guides). Write brief suicide note.
5. **Exit** - Leave note visible. Exit the game space.

**Example Note:**
> *"I loved him more than my vows, more than my soul. He loved another. There is nothing left. Forgive me, God. — Cristina"*

**For You (Player Cris):**
- This is emotional but understated
- Don't feel you must "perform" anguish—silence is powerful
- GM will check in beforehand to ensure you're comfortable

## Special Abilities

### Séance Leader
You control the mood during séances. Use candles, incense, atmospheric language. This is your moment to shine (and provide clues).

### Spiritual Intuition
You can "sense" things about people:
- *"There's so much tension here tonight... the spirits are restless..."*
- *"I sense guilt... someone here carries a heavy burden..."*

Use this to add atmosphere without revealing specifics.

### Rosary Comfort
If someone is distraught, offer to pray with them. This creates intimate, vulnerable moments.

## Costume & Props

**Costume:**
- 1920s modest dress (deep blue, burgundy, or black)
- Long sleeves, high neck (reflecting former nun modesty)
- Simple cross necklace
- Hair pinned back neatly

**Props:**
- Rosary beads (hidden in pocket or worn as bracelet)
- Small prayer book
- Matches (for lighting séance candles)
- Handkerchief (for nervous hands or tears)

## Final Notes

Play Emília as **soft-spoken, otherworldly, and heartbreakingly trusting**. She floats through the party like a ghost herself—present but not quite of this world.

When the betrayal is revealed, her silence will be more devastating than any scream.

**Trust the GM. Trust yourself. And trust that your exit will resonate long after the game ends.**

*May God have mercy on us all.*
