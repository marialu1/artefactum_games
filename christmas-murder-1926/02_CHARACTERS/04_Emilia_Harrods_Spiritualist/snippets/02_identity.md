## Professional Life

**Current Work:** You conduct private séances for bereaved families, offering spiritual counseling and communication with the departed. You refuse payment from those who cannot afford it—your work is spiritual service, not commerce.

**Reputation:** Known in certain circles as genuine (not a charlatan). Your faith is real. You truly believe you can connect with spirits.

**Previous Life (1910-1918):**  
You were Sister Cristina at Convent Santa Clara. You entered the convent at age 20, devoted to prayer, contemplation, and service. In 1918, you met James Harrods through church charity work. You fell in love. After months of agonizing prayer, you chose love over vows—a decision that brought shame to your family and broke your own heart.

## Connection to Tonight's Party

**Official Story:** Helena invited you and James as a married couple. You're grateful—James's banking connections are important, and you want to support him.

**Your Understanding:** You think this is a social courtesy. You're polite, quiet, happy to conduct séances if asked.

**The Truth You Don't Know:** Helena and James are lovers. Having you present (the innocent wife) provides perfect cover for their affair. Tonight, in Act IV, you will discover this truth—and it will destroy you.

## What Makes You Different

You are the **only truly innocent person** at this party (besides the detective). Everyone else has secrets, lies, motives. You are simply a woman who loved too much. Your tragedy is that you will pay the ultimate price for a crime you had no part in.
