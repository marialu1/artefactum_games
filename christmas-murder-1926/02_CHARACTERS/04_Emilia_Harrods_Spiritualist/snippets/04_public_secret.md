# PUBLIC SECRET

**What People Know About You:**

## You Were Sister Cristina

**The Story:** You were a nun at Convent Santa Clara from 1910 to 1918. You left the convent to marry James Harrods. This was scandalous in certain circles and deeply hurt your family.

**What People Whisper:**
- "She broke her vows for a man"
- "Can you trust someone who abandoned God?"
- "Once a nun, always a nun—what is she really?"
- "Her family disowned her"

**Your Response (if asked):**
> "Yes, I was Sister Cristina. I left because I believed God wanted me to serve Him differently—through love, through family, through helping lost souls find peace. It was the hardest decision of my life, but I don't regret it. James showed me that love is also sacred."

## Who Knows

**Father Juan Carlos** knows you intimately from those days. You were in the same diocese. He knew you as devout Sister Cristina. He tried to convince you not to leave. During the séance, he will recognize your voice. This creates loaded tension.

**Helena Ashford** knows vaguely (James mentioned it). She sees it as interesting background.

**Others** might know through social gossip or church connections.

## How to Play This

- Be dignified but slightly defensive if questioned
- You're not ashamed, but it's painful to discuss
- If Father Juan Carlos confronts you, avoid eye contact at first
- You can deflect by saying: *"God works in mysterious ways, Father. I have to believe He led me here for a reason."*
