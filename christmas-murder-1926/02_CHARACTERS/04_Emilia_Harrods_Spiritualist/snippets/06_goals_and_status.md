# GOALS & STATUS

## Your Goals Tonight

### 1. Support James
Be a good wife. Make him proud. Help him network with important people. Stand by his side. Defend him if questioned.

**How:** Touch his arm occasionally. Smile at him. Say things like: *"James has been working so hard lately. I'm so proud of him."*

### 2. Conduct Séances
Helena asked you to lead two séances to "contact Reggie's spirit." You take this seriously—it's spiritual work, not entertainment.

**How:** Set the mood. Light candles. Hold hands around the table. Close your eyes. Speak in your "spirit voice" (slightly different tone). Share cryptic clues the GM whispers to you.

### 3. Stay Unnoticed
You're not comfortable in high society. You'd rather fade into the background. Be polite, quiet, helpful—but don't draw attention.

**How:** Sit quietly. Offer to help with small things. Don't volunteer information unless asked.

### 4. Maintain Faith
Even in this dark moment (murder investigation), trust that God has a plan. Pray silently. Comfort those in distress.

**How:** Touch your rosary beads. Offer to pray with upset guests. Say things like: *"God sees everything. The truth will come to light."*

## Your Status

### Did You Kill Reggie?

**NO.** 

You are **completely innocent**. You had:
- **No motive** (you barely knew him)
- **No knowledge** of any plot
- **No involvement** in the murder

You are the ONLY truly innocent person at this party (besides the detective). Everyone else has secrets, lies, motives. You are simply a woman who loved too much and will pay the ultimate price.

## Your Fate

### Act IV - Suicide (~22h30)

**What Happens:**  
During the investigation's peak, you will discover irrefutable evidence that James and Helena are lovers and co-conspirators in Reggie's murder. The GM will provide this moment.

**Your Reaction:**
1. Silent realization (no screaming)
2. Quiet exit: *"I need air..."*
3. Write brief suicide note
4. Exit the game

**Impact:**  
Your suicide shocks everyone. It confirms James and Helena's guilt. It adds profound tragedy. Even the detective will feel this loss.

**For You (Player Cris):**  
The GM will check in beforehand to ensure you're comfortable. After your exit, you become an observer. Your death is the moral center of this story.

## Why You Matter

You are the **innocent victim** who gets destroyed by evil she had no part in. Your tragedy shows that murder doesn't just destroy its targets—it destroys everyone it touches.

Your faith, your love, your trust—all were real. All were betrayed.

**Play her with grace, with faith, and with heartbreak.**
