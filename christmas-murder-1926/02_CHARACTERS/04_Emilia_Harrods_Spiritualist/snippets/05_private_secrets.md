# PRIVATE SECRETS

**Information ONLY you know. Do NOT reveal unless strategically necessary.**

## Secret #1: You Still Pray to the Virgin Mary

**The Secret:**  
Despite leaving the convent, you never left your faith. Every night, you pray the rosary. You light candles to the Virgin Mary. You attend Mass when James isn't looking (he finds it "excessive"). You are still, in your heart, a nun who chose love—but the spiritual wound never healed.

**Why It's Secret:**  
James thinks you've "moved on" from that life. If he knew how deeply you still cling to it, he might question your commitment to your marriage. You don't want him to think you regret choosing him.

**If Discovered:**  
Someone might find your hidden rosary or see you crossing yourself. You can say: *"Old habits. They bring me comfort."*

**Strategic Use:**  
This can humanize you or make you seem more mystical/mysterious.

## Secret #2: You Know Reggie Was Evil

**The Secret:**  
During a charity event six months ago, you briefly touched Reggie's hand. You felt something—a darkness, a coldness. In your spiritual belief system, this was a sign. You believe Reggie had sold his soul or harbored deep evil. You've been uneasy around him ever since but said nothing (it would sound insane).

**Why It's Secret:**  
Saying "I felt evil in him" makes you sound like a superstitious hysteric. James already worries people think you're "too mystical." You kept it to yourself.

**If Discovered:**  
If someone asks why you seem unsurprised Reggie is dead, you might hint: *"I'm a medium. Sometimes I sense when someone is... marked."*

**Strategic Use:**  
This can be used to deflect suspicion OR to seem mysteriously knowing. It also establishes your genuine spiritual abilities (you were RIGHT about Reggie).

## Secret #3: You've Felt James Pulling Away

**The Secret:**  
For the past year, James has been distant. Fewer embraces. Late nights "at the bank." Distracted during dinner. You've told yourself it's work stress, but deep down, a quiet voice whispers: *He doesn't love you anymore.*

You've been terrified to confront this because if you lost James, you'd have nothing—no convent, no family (they disowned you), no identity. So you smile, you pray, you pretend everything is fine.

**Why It's Secret:**  
Admitting this would mean admitting your worst fear. You're in denial.

**When You Discover (Act IV, ~22h30):**  
You will find evidence (GM will provide—perhaps a love letter, or overhearing a confession, or putting pieces together). Your world will collapse. You will write a suicide note and exit the game. This is your tragic end.

**How to Play This:**  
Until Act IV, you are in DENIAL. If someone asks if your marriage is okay, you smile and say: *"James works so hard. I know he loves me."* You defend him fiercely. The betrayal will be all the more devastating because you refused to see it coming.

## Secret #4: You Recognize Father Juan Carlos's Voice (And He Recognizes Yours)

**The Secret:**  
You and Father Juan Carlos were in the same diocese during your convent years. He knew you as Sister Cristina. You haven't seen him in years, but during the séance, when you speak in your "spirit voice," he will recognize you. And you will recognize his voice when he speaks.

This creates a loaded, unspoken tension: *He knows who you were. He knows you left. He probably judged you.*

**Why It's Secret:**  
You don't want to address your past in front of James or strangers. It's painful. If Father Juan Carlos confronts you privately, you might say: *"Yes, Father. I remember you. Please don't—I can't go back."*

**Strategic Use:**  
This connection can add dramatic tension. Father Juan Carlos might feel protective of you (he knew you as innocent). When you die, his grief will be profound.

**Key Moment:**  
During the séance (Act III), when you're in your "spirit voice," lock eyes with Father Juan Carlos for just a moment. Let him see the recognition. Then look away. This silent exchange will speak volumes.

## IMPORTANT: The Suicide Discovery (Act IV)

**This is the culmination of Secret #3.**

When the GM signals you (around 22h30, Act IV), you will discover irrefutable evidence that James and Helena are lovers and co-conspirators in Reggie's murder. This might be:
- A love letter you find
- Overhearing a confession
- Puzzle pieces suddenly clicking together
- GM provides the triggering moment

**Your Reaction:**
1. **Silent Realization** - Don't scream. Don't accuse. Just... understand.
2. **Quiet Exit** - Excuse yourself: *"I need air..."*
3. **Write Suicide Note** - Brief, heartbreaking. Example:
   > *"I loved him more than my vows, more than my soul. He loved another. There is nothing left. Forgive me, God. — Cristina"*
4. **Exit Game** - Leave note visible. GM announces your death shortly after.

**For Player (Cris):**  
This is emotional and heavy. The GM will check in beforehand. After your exit, you become an observer. Your death will shock everyone and add profound tragedy to the story.

**Remember:** These are PRIVATE SECRETS. Play them close to your chest until the right dramatic moment—or until Act IV, when everything falls apart.
