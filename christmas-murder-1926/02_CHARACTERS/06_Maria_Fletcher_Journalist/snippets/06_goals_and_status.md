# GOALS AND STATUS

## Your Status Tonight

**Innocence:** ✅ INNOCENT (you did NOT kill Reggie)  
**Suspicion Level:** 🔴 MAXIMUM (obvious motive, prime suspect)  
**Danger:** Everyone will suspect you first

---

## Your Three Goals

### PRIMARY GOAL: Clear Your Name

**When Reggie dies, everyone will suspect YOU.**

**Your Mission:**
1. Prove you're innocent (find real killer OR create reasonable doubt)
2. Avoid being arrested (you've survived 3 years - NOT going to prison now)

**Strategy:**
- Be visibly helpful in investigation (innocent people cooperate)
- Share observations (prove you're seeking truth, not hiding)
- Establish alibi (where were you when murder happened?)
- Find evidence pointing to someone else (redirect suspicion)
- Stay calm, logical, professional (panic looks guilty)

**Success = Walking out free**

---

### SECONDARY GOAL: Solve the Mystery

**Why You Care:**

**Professional Pride:**
- You're investigative journalist (this is YOUR skillset)
- Someone commits murder in front of YOU?
- You've solved complex stories before - you can solve this

**Personal Vindication:**
- If you solve this, PROVE your skills
- Reggie destroyed career saying you were "sloppy journalist"
- Solving his murder = ultimate proof you're NOT
- Possible headline: "Disgraced Journalist Solves Ashford Murder" = redemption

**Justice:**
- You genuinely believe in justice
- Murder is wrong (even if victim was terrible person)
- Truth should win
- Someone needs to speak for... wait, speak for REGGIE? (That's weird. But truth is truth.)

**Success = Solving mystery before anyone else**

---

### HIDDEN GOAL: Find Satisfaction (and Deal With It)

**Complex Emotions:**

Part of you hoped something would happen to Reggie.
(Not murder, necessarily, but... something.)

Now he's dead.

**You feel:**
- **Satisfaction** (he can't hurt anyone anymore)
- **Guilt** (shouldn't feel satisfied)
- **Fear** (makes you look guilty)
- **Relief** (he's gone)
- **Curiosity** (WHO did it? WHY? Was it justice or murder?)

**Reconciling This:**
- During game, grapple with these emotions
- Maybe confide in someone (JC? Daisy?) about complexity
- Or keep internal (shows inner conflict)
- Accept that feelings are complicated (human to feel relief at abuser's death)

**Success = Finding peace with your reaction**

---

## Optional Goal: Rehabilitation

**If You Solve This:**

**Imagine:**
- Story for papers: "Disgraced Journalist Solves Ashford Murder"
- Redemption arc complete
- Maybe... papers would hire you again?
- Byline in *New York Herald* again?
- Awards reinstated?
- Career rebuilt?

**Your Fantasy:**
Full vindication. Public apology from Herald. Job offers.

**Reality:**
Probably won't happen. But you can hope.

**Success = Finding way back to journalism**

---

## Current Status Summary

**Financial:** Barely surviving ($30/week), in debt  
**Professional:** Blacklisted, writing as "M.A. Sterling"  
**Emotional:** Wounded, angry, determined  
**Social:** Isolated, lonely, no close friends  
**Legal:** About to become murder suspect

**Tonight Changes Everything:**
- Either you clear name and possibly resurrect career
- Or you go to prison for murder you didn't commit

**No pressure.**

## Obstacles to Your Goals

**Goal 1 (Clear Name):**
- Obvious motive (everyone knows)
- No alibi (probably alone when murder happened)
- Obsessive behavior (if "Ashford File II" found)
- Emotional investment (hard to stay objective)

**Goal 2 (Solve Mystery):**
- Prime suspect = people don't trust you
- JC might be better investigator (competition)
- Emotional investment clouds judgment
- Time pressure (before you're arrested)

**Goal 3 (Find Satisfaction):**
- Guilt about relief
- Moral complexity (is relief wrong?)
- Can't show satisfaction (looks guilty)
- Processing trauma while under suspicion
