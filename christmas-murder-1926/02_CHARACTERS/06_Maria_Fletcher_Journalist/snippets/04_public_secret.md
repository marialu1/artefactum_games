> *November 18, 1923*
>
> The Herald retracts its June 15 article titled "The Ashford Empire: Built on Greed and Lies."

## Your Defense Strategy

### When Accused (And You Will Be)

**Acknowledge the Motive:**
- "Yes, I hated him. I HATED him."
- "He destroyed my career, my reputation, three years of my life."
- "My mother lost her house because of him."
- Don't deny the hate - it's obvious

**But Separate Motive from Action:**
- "Motive isn't proof."
- "I'm a journalist. I fight with WORDS, not violence."
- "You think I'd risk prison? Throw away everything I've survived?"
- "I came here to WATCH him, not kill him."

**Redirect to Evidence:**
- "Where's the physical evidence linking ME to the murder?"
- "Who saw me near the body? Who has actual PROOF?"
- "Let's look at facts, not assumptions."

## Playing This Secret

**Don't Hide It:**
- Everyone knows anyway
- Hiding makes you look guiltier
- Own it: "Yes, I had motive. So what?"

**Use It:**
- Your obvious suspicion gives cover to actual killer
- While they suspect you, real killer operates freely
- You can investigate openly (clearing your name = legitimate goal)

**Turn It Into Strength:**
- "Because I'm obvious suspect, I have most reason to find real killer"
- "I solve this = prove my innocence AND my skills"
- "Who better to investigate than journalist?"

## The Irony

**You've fantasized about Reggie's death for 3 years.**

But you DIDN'T kill him.

**Now someone else did what you only imagined.**

And you're the one who has to prove you're innocent.

**Complex emotions:**
- Relief (he's dead)
- Guilt (for feeling relieved)
- Fear (everyone suspects you)
- Determination (clear your name)
- Curiosity (who actually did it?)

## Key Quote

*"Yes, I wanted him to face consequences. I wanted JUSTICE. I wanted the truth about him to destroy his reputation the way he destroyed mine.*

*But I wanted that to happen through journalism. Through WORDS. Through TRUTH.*

*Not through murder."*
