# PRIVATE SECRETS

## What You Hide From Everyone

### Secret #1: The Dark Fantasies

**You've Fantasized About Reggie's Death.**

For three years, you've imagined scenarios:
- Heart attack during business meeting
- Hit by automobile
- Exposed so thoroughly he kills himself
- Public humiliation that destroys him completely

**You never planned to act on these fantasies.**

But you've thought about them. Often.

**Tonight, when he dies:**
- Part of you feels RELIEF (Good. He's dead. He can't hurt anyone anymore.)
- Part of you feels GUILT (I shouldn't feel this way. I'm not a monster.)
- Part of you feels FEAR (Everyone will think I did this.)

**This secret makes you vulnerable:**
- If anyone knew you fantasized about his death, they'd be certain you killed him
- The line between thinking and doing feels uncomfortably thin tonight
- You have to be VERY careful not to show satisfaction at his death

### Secret #2: The Obsessive Surveillance

**You've Been Following Reggie.**

Not every day, but regularly:
- Watch his house sometimes (from safe distance)
- Track his public appearances
- Maintain detailed notebook: "Ashford File II"
- Collect information obsessively

**What you've documented:**
- Business meetings (who he meets, when, where)
- Affairs (Daisy Vermont, confirmed via surveillance)
- Helena's behavior (signs of abuse)
- Suspicious financial activity (can't prove yet, but patterns)

**If anyone finds "Ashford File II":**
- They'd realize your obsession goes beyond professional interest
- 200+ pages of notes on one man
- This looks like stalking (because it kind of is)
- Makes you look VERY guilty

**Why you did this:**
- Professional: gathering evidence for eventual second exposé
- Personal: can't let go, need to prove you were RIGHT
- Obsessive: this consumed you

### Secret #3: The Miniature Camera

**You Brought a Hidden Camera Tonight.**

Tucked in your purse, disguised.

**Your plan:**
- Photograph anything useful
- Maybe Reggie drunk, saying something incriminating
- Document evidence for future article
- Professional tool... or stalker behavior?

**If found:**
- "Why would innocent guest bring hidden camera?"
- Looks premeditated
- Supports "she was planning something" theory

**Truth:**
- You're ALWAYS prepared to document
- Journalist habit
- But tonight, especially motivated

### Secret #4: The Alternative Career Path You Almost Took

**March 1924: You Almost Gave Up.**

After Herald fired you, blacklisted, drowning in debt:
- Thought about becoming teacher (like mother)
- Thought about leaving New York entirely
- Thought about quitting journalism forever

**What stopped you:**
- Stubborn pride ("He doesn't get to WIN")
- Anger ("I was RIGHT. Truth matters.")
- Can't imagine life without investigating

**But some days you wonder:**
- Was it worth it?
- Should you have just stayed quiet?
- Would you be happy now if you'd chosen differently?

**Tonight, these doubts resurface:**
- Especially if accused of murder
- "I sacrificed everything for truth. And for what?"

---

### Secret #5: The Loneliness

**You're Profoundly Lonely.**

**No close friends:**
- Work consumed your life before
- After fall, colleagues avoided you
- Too proud to ask for help
- Too wounded to be vulnerable

**Romantic life: nonexistent**
- One brief relationship 1920 (didn't work - he wanted traditional wife)
- Since then: nothing
- Who would want to date "failed" journalist?
- Too busy surviving to think about love

**Family: complicated**
- Mother loves you but doesn't understand
- Father dead (you miss him every day)
- No siblings

**Tonight:**
- Surrounded by people at party
- But fundamentally ALONE
- If accused, who will defend you?
- If in trouble, who will help?

**This drives your investigation:**
- Need to prove yourself ALONE
- No one else will save you
- You've always been alone

### Secret #6: You Kept One Letter

**From Your Editor (Former Mentor):**

Received it day after you were fired:

> *"Maria,*
>
> *I'm sorry. The board forced my hand. Ashford's connections...*
>
> *You were right. The article was solid. Best work I've seen.*
>
> *But sometimes being right isn't enough.*
>
> *Don't stop writing.*
>
> *-J.H."*

**You've read it hundreds of times.**

When you doubt yourself, you read it again.

"You were right."

**Why this matters tonight:**
- Reminds you why you fight
- Someone believed in you
- Truth DID matter (even if it didn't win)

## How These Secrets Affect Tonight

### If Maria's Secrets Are Discovered:

**Ashford File II found:**
- "She's been STALKING him!"
- Obsession confirmed
- Motive strengthened

**Camera found:**
- "She planned something!"
- Premeditation suggested
- Very damning

**Fantasies revealed (somehow):**
- "She WANTED him dead!"
- Thought = intent?
- Most damning of all

### Your Strategy:

**Keep these hidden at all costs.**

**If forced to explain:**
- Ashford File II: "Professional research for eventual article"
- Camera: "Journalist tools, always carry them"
- Fantasies: NEVER admit these

**But internally:**
- These secrets weigh on you
- Guilt mixes with anger
- Complex moral territory

---

## The Core Truth

**You hated Reggie Ashford.**

**You fantasized about his death.**

**You obsessively documented his life.**

**BUT YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.**

The line between thought and action is EVERYTHING.

And you didn't cross it.

(Even though part of you wanted to.)

---

## Playing These Secrets

**Don't reveal unless forced to.**

**Show internal conflict through:**
- Brief hesitations
- Micro-expressions of guilt/relief
- Defensive reactions when pressed
- Careful word choices

**Example:**

Player: "Did you want him dead?"

You: [pause, too long] "I... wanted justice."

Player: "That's not an answer."

You: [meeting their eyes] "I wanted him to face consequences. Yes."

[Not quite a lie. Not quite the truth.]
