[Stand, notebook in hand]

"You want the truth? Fine.

Yes, Reginald Ashford destroyed my career. My reputation. Three years of my life.

I hated him. I HATED him.

I fantasized about justice. About him facing consequences.

But I'm a JOURNALIST. I fight with WORDS. With TRUTH. Not with... whatever killed him.

You think I'd risk prison? Throw away everything I've fought to survive?

I came here tonight hoping he'd make a mistake. Say something I could use for an article. That's ALL.

Someone killed him. But it wasn't me.

And I'll prove it."
