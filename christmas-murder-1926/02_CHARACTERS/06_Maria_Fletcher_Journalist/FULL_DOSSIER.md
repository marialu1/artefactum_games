**1922-1923: The Reggie Ashford Investigation**

**How It Started (October 1922):**

Anonymous tip: *"Look into Reginald Ashford III. Real estate deals. Something wrong."*

**Maria's Research (Oct 1922 - June 1923, 8 months):**

**What She Discovered:**
1. **Property Fraud:** Reggie bought tenement buildings, evicted tenants, sold for profit
2. **Bribery:** Paid city officials to rezone neighborhoods (making his properties valuable)
3. **Predatory Loans:** Gave loans to desperate families, foreclosed when they couldn't pay
4. **Blackmail:** Used private detectives to dig up dirt on business rivals
5. **Tax Evasion:** Offshore accounts, shell companies (illegal even in 1920s)

**Evidence:**
- Bank records (leaked by sympathetic bank employee)
- Testimony from 12 evicted families
- Documents showing bribes (photocopied from city hall - risky)
- Letter from Reggie to lawyer detailing blackmail scheme

**Maria's Notebook:**
200 pages of notes. Names, dates, amounts. Airtight case.

---

**June 15, 1923: "The Ashford Empire: Built on Greed and Lies"**

**The Article:**
- Published front page, *New York Herald*
- 5,000 words
- Named Reggie specifically
- Detailed his methods
- Called for federal investigation
- Quote: *"Men like Reginald Ashford III profit from the suffering of the poor. This must end."*

**Immediate Reaction:**
- National attention (reprinted in 15 other papers)
- Public outrage
- Calls for investigation
- Maria's editor: *"Best journalism I've seen in 20 years."*

**Maria felt:** Triumphant. This is what journalism is FOR.

---

**June 16-17, 1923: Reggie's Response**

**Step 1:** Hired expensive lawyers (five of them).

**Step 2:** Filed libel lawsuit (claimed article was FALSE, DAMAGED reputation).

**Step 3:** Used connections (judges, politicians, media owners).

**The Legal Battle (June-November 1923):**

**Maria's Defense:**
- Truth is absolute defense against libel
- She HAD evidence
- Herald provided legal team

**Reggie's Strategy:**
- Challenge evidence sourcing (bank employee was "unauthorized")
- Claim documents were "stolen" (technically true - photocopied without permission)
- Pressure Herald owners (threaten advertisers, business relationships)
- Find technicality (evicted families signed "settlements" with non-disclosure clauses)

---

**November 1923: The Verdict**

**Judge ruled:** Reggie WINS on technicality.

**Reasoning:**
- Some evidence obtained "improperly" (tainted)
- Families' testimony "inadmissible" (NDAs)
- One date wrong in article (minor error, but enough)

**Reality:** Reggie's wealth and connections bought the verdict.

**Outcome:**
- Maria ordered to pay $25,000 damages (more than 5 years salary)
- Article retracted
- Reggie "exonerated" (in legal sense only)

---

**November 1923 - January 1924: The Destruction**

**Immediate Consequences:**

**Financial:**
- Can't pay $25,000 (negotiated down to $10,000, still crushing)
- Mother mortgaged house to help (Maria felt HORRIBLE)
- In debt for years

**Professional:**
- Herald fired her (pressure from ownership - Reggie's business associates)
- Blacklisted (Reggie sent letters to every major publication: "Don't hire her")
- No newspaper would touch her
- Award rescinded (Press Club - Reggie's friends on board)

**Personal:**
- Reputation smeared ("sloppy journalist," "bitter woman," "reckless")
- Former colleagues avoided her (afraid of association)
- Felt betrayed (journalism failed her after she served it faithfully)

**Depression (Jan-March 1924):**
- Stayed in tiny apartment for weeks
- Thought about quitting (maybe teach? like mother?)
- But couldn't give up (too stubborn, too angry)

---

#### **SURVIVAL (1924-1926): The Struggle**

**March 1924: Decision**

*"He can take my byline. He can't take my voice."*

**New Strategy:**
- Write under pseudonym: **"M.A. Sterling"**
- Smaller publications (can't be blacklisted from papers Reggie doesn't know about)
- Different beat (not investigations - too risky)
- Human interest, local stories, book reviews

**Current Income (1924-1926):**
- Freelance for small papers: $15-30/week (barely survival)
- Part-time work (editing, proofreading): $10/week
- Total: ~$30/week (Herald paid $50/week - significant drop)

**Living Situation:**
- Tiny studio apartment, Lower East Side (one room, shared bathroom in hall)
- Compared to Herald days (nice one-bedroom, Upper West Side)

**Daily Life:**
- Still wakes at 5am (old habit)
- Writes morning pages (keeps skill sharp)
- Library (free, warm, books)
- Walks everywhere (can't afford subway often)
- Eats cheaply (bread, soup, occasional egg)
- Mother sends care packages (feels ashamed but grateful)

---

**Secret Journalism (1924-1926):**

**Maria Never Stopped Investigating.**

**Current Project:** Following Reggie Ashford. Obsessively.

**Method:**
- Watches his house sometimes (from distance)
- Reads society pages (tracks his public appearances)
- Maintains notebook: "Ashford File II"
- Collects information (waiting for moment to use it)

**What She Knows (but hasn't published):**
- Reggie's marriage seems unhappy (Helena looks scared)
- Business dealings still shady (she can't prove it yet)
- Multiple affairs (Daisy Vermont, others)
- Enemies accumulating (he's made a lot)

**Her Fantasy:**
Second article. Better sourced. Airtight. Vindication.

But also: **Revenge.** (She won't admit this, but it's true.)

---

Not actively planned. But imagined.

**Tonight, When Body Is Discovered:**

**Immediately followed by:** GUILT. *"I shouldn't feel this way. I'm not a monster."*

**Then:** SUSPICION. *"Who killed him? Why? I need to KNOW."*

**And Finally:** FEAR. *"Everyone knows I had motive. They'll suspect ME."*

---

**If He's Killed:**

---

---

- Friendly rivalry

**Player Choice:** Decide which approach feels right based on how you interact.

**If You Collaborate:**
Might develop mutual respect, possibly friendship (or more - he's intelligent, dedicated, around your age... but focus on mystery first).

---

### **DAISY VALMONT (Cabaret Singer) - COMPLEX ALLIANCE**

**What You Know:**
- Cabaret singer (talented, from what you've heard)
- Reggie's mistress (confirmed - you saw them)
- Also creative woman in male-dominated world (commonality)

**Your Feelings:**
- Sympathy (Reggie used her too)

- Possible bonding (if you talk, might find common ground)
- "The enemy of my enemy..." (both have reasons to hate Reggie)

**If She's Accused:**

---

**What You Know:**
- Parish priest, respected
- Hears confessions (knows SECRETS)

- Curiosity (what has he heard?)

**Tonight's Dynamic:**
- Polite (he's guest, he's priest)
- Probe carefully (can you get him to hint without breaking seal?)
- Philosophical debates possible (truth vs. faith, justice vs. mercy)

**Tension Point:**
If he knows something relevant but won't share due to confessional seal:
- You: *"People's lives are at stake. Truth matters more than rules."*
- Him: *"God's law supersedes human law."*
- You: *"That's convenient when it protects killers."*

---

### **OTHER GUESTS - POTENTIAL SOURCES**

**James Harrods (Banker):**
- Business dealings with Reggie (follow the money)
- Might know financial secrets

**Emilia Harrods (Spiritualist):**
- Interesting contrast (mystic vs. your empiricism)
- Might have observed things others missed (intuitive)

- Outsider like you (immigrant, creative industry)
- Might have useful information

**Claire & Denise (Twins):**
- Reggie's daughters (fascinating - why hidden?)
- Potentially valuable witnesses

---

## 🎯 PART 4: YOUR GOALS TONIGHT

### **PRIMARY GOAL: CLEAR YOUR NAME**

**When Reggie Dies:**

**Everyone Will Suspect You.** (Obvious motive: revenge)

**Your Mission:**
1. **Prove you're innocent** (either find real killer OR create reasonable doubt)
2. **Avoid being arrested** (you've survived 3 years struggling - you're NOT going to prison for something you didn't do)

**Strategy:**
- Be visibly HELPFUL in investigation (innocent people cooperate)
- Share your observations (show you're seeking truth, not hiding it)
- Establish alibi (where were you when murder happened?)
- Find evidence pointing to someone else (redirect suspicion)

---

### **SECONDARY GOAL: SOLVE THE MYSTERY**

**Why You Care:**

**Professional Pride:**
- You're investigative journalist (this is your SKILLSET)
- Someone thinks they can get away with murder in front of YOU?
- You've solved complex stories before - you can solve this

**Personal Vindication:**
- If you solve this, PROVE your skills
- Reggie destroyed your career saying you were "sloppy journalist"
- Solving his murder = ultimate proof you're NOT

**Justice:**
- You genuinely believe in justice
- Murder is wrong (even if victim was terrible person)
- Truth should win

---

### **HIDDEN GOAL: FIND SATISFACTION**

**Complex Emotions:**

**Part of you hoped something would happen to Reggie.**
(Not murder, necessarily, but... something.)

**Now he's dead.**

**You feel:**
- Satisfaction (he can't hurt anyone anymore)
- Guilt (shouldn't feel satisfied)
- Fear (makes you look guilty)
- Curiosity (WHO did it? WHY? Was it justice or murder?)

**Reconciling This:**
- During game, your character grapples with these emotions
- Maybe you confide in someone (JC? Daisy?) about complexity
- Or keep it internal (shows inner conflict)

---

### **OPTIONAL GOAL: REHABILITATION**

**If You Solve This:**

**Imagine:**
- Story for papers: "Disgraced Journalist Solves Ashford Murder"
- Redemption arc
- Maybe... papers would hire you again?

**Your Fantasy:**
Byline in *New York Herald* again. Full vindication.

**Reality:**
Probably won't happen. But you can hope.

---

## 🎭 PART 5: HOW TO PLAY MARIA

- Professional curiosity
- "Help me understand"

---

#### **3. THE WOUNDED IDEALIST**

**Your State:**
- Nervous (why did you accept invitation?)
- Proud (won't show weakness)
- Alert (watching everyone)

**Key Moment: Greeting Reggie**

Reggie (Ricardo): *"Ah, Miss Fletcher. Still... writing?"* [condescending]

You: *"Yes, Mr. Ashford. Still seeking truth."* [cool, pointed]

[Brief eye contact: neither backs down]

---

**During Party (Before Murder):**
- Circulate, observe
- Mental notes: *"Helena looks tense. James Harrods seems worried. Daisy is... performing (for Reggie?)."*

**Your Reaction:**
1. **Shock** (genuine - didn't expect murder)

**Theory Formation:**
*"Based on what we know: [explain logical deduction]. Which means..."*

**Defending Yourself (If Accused):**

**If Evidence Points to You:**

**Tier 2 Clue: Newspaper Clipping (Your Ruined Career)**

Someone: *"This proves you had motive!"*

You: *"Of course I had motive. I never hid that. But motive isn't proof. WHO HAD OPPORTUNITY? WHO has evidence linking them to the actual murder?"*

**If Voted Into Top 3 Suspects:**

**Your Defense Speech:**

[Stand, notebook in hand]

> *"You want to know the truth? Fine.*
>
> *Yes, Reginald Ashford destroyed my career. My reputation. Three years of my life.*
>
> *I hated him. I HATED him.*
>
> *I fantasized about justice. About him facing consequences.*
>
> *But I'm a JOURNALIST. I fight with WORDS. With TRUTH. Not with... whatever killed him.*
>
> *You think I'd risk prison? Throw away everything I've fought to survive?*
>
> *I came here tonight hoping he'd make mistake. Say something I could use for article. That's ALL.*
>
> *Someone killed him. But it wasn't me.*
>
> *And I'll prove it."*

[Sit down, open notebook, continue investigating]
