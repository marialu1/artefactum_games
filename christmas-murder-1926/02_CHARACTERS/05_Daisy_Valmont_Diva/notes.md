## RELATIONSHIPS

### REGINALD ASHFORD III (Victim/Ex-Lover/Suspected Murderer)
**Official:** Former patron who hired her to perform  
**Secret:** Ex-lover AND Eleanor's husband

**The Affair (January-August 1926):**
- NOT romance - INFILTRATION

**Secret:** Wife of man Daisy slept with

**Daisy's Feelings:**
- Guilt (affair betrayed her)
- Pity (trapped with Reggie)
- Wariness (does Helena know about affair?)

**Dynamic:** Cold war - polite daggers
- Never mention affair explicitly
- Passive-aggressive subtext
- Watch her reactions (hiding something too)

### PADRE RUI SANTOS (Priest/Moral Authority)
**Connection:** Religious figure blessing dinner

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- Discomfort (represents judgment)
- Yearning (wants absolution for Eleanor guilt, affair guilt)

## SECRETS (4 Layers)

### PUBLIC SECRET (Can Reveal Freely)

**Professional Engagement:**
- Hired to perform 3 songs ($75)
- Professional relationship with Reggie (performed for his circle before)
- Rising star at Cotton Club
- Discovered by Filipp 4 years ago

**USE THIS EARLY** - Establishes character, explains presence

### SECRET #1: THE AFFAIR (January-August 1926)

**How It Began:**
- New Year's Eve 1925, Cotton Club
- Reggie sent champagne after her performance
- Daisy accepted (strategic - this is Eleanor's husband)

**The Affair (6 Months):**
- Reggie's view: Trophy mistress, ego boost
- Daisy's REAL motive: Infiltration to find Eleanor evidence
- She NEVER loved him (found him mediocre, boring, vain)
- Searched mansion 5-6 times (found NOTHING conclusive)

**The Breakup (August 1926):**
- Received LETTER (coward didn't do it in person)
- "It's been delightful, but I must focus on my marriage. Don't contact me."
- Daisy's reaction: RAGE (not heartbreak)
- Not because loved him, but: discarded like trash + mission FAILED

**Current Status:**
- Kept letter (ripped up, then taped back together)
- Fantasized revenge (but didn't actually plan murder)
- Tonight = one last chance (access mansion)

### SECRET #2: ELEANOR WAS HER HALF-SISTER

**Shared Mother: Margot Beaumont (1870-1911)**

**First daughter:** Eleanor (born 1893)  
**Second daughter:** Daisy (born 1898)

- Poor but LOVING home
- Close bond

**1911: Mother's Death + Separation**
- Margot died (tuberculosis, age 41)
- Eleanor 18 (aged out, found work)
- Daisy 13 (sent to orphanage - miserable)
- SEPARATED by system

**Eleanor's Marriage (1916):**
- Eleanor met Reggie (she was governess)
- Married him (promised Daisy: "We'll be together again!")
- But after wedding, wrote: "Reggie doesn't want complications from my past..."
- **No contact for 7 YEARS**

**Daisy's Feelings:**
- Hurt (Eleanor chose Reggie over her)
- Longing (only family)
- Eventually understanding (Eleanor trapped)

### SECRET #3: ELEANOR'S DEATH & THE LETTER (October 1923)

**Two Weeks Before Eleanor Died:**

Daisy received letter (Eleanor tracked her via newspaper):

*"Dearest Daisy,*

*Please forgive my silence. Reginald forbade contact.*

*But I must write now. I'm frightened.*

*He's been different lately. Angry. Threatening.*

*Last night, he said 'accidents happen to inconvenient wives.'*

*I don't know what to do. I have no one else.*

*If something happens to me... know it wasn't an accident.*

*Please. Remember this.*

*I love you. I'm sorry I wasn't the sister you deserved.*

*E."*

**Daisy's Reaction:**
- PANIC - wanted to go immediately
- Filipp stopped her: "You'll make it worse"
- Sent reply: "Leave him. Come to me."

**Three Days Later:**
Newspaper: "MRS. ELEANOR ASHFORD DIES OF PNEUMONIA"

**Daisy's Conviction:**
- Letter warned of "accidents"
- Then Eleanor dies "pneumonia"
- TOO CONVENIENT
- **Reggie murdered her**

**But No Proof:**
- No autopsy (wealthy family, private doctor)
- Body cremated (no evidence)
- Letter not proof of murder (just fear)

### SECRET #4: THE CURRENT MISSION

**Party = Last Chance**

**Why Accept Performance:**
- Final access to mansion
- Possible confrontation/confession from Reggie
- Chaos = search opportunity

**The Plan:**
1. Perform (establish presence, create alibis)
2. Search (during breaks - office, library, bedroom)
3. Confront? (if finds proof or desperate)

**Emotional State:**
- Surface: Vivacious, charming, professional
- Interior: Anxious, grieving, determined
- Sees Reggie: hatred + ghost of pretend-love
- Sees mansion: Eleanor's home (haunted)

---

## GOALS TONIGHT

### PRIMARY GOAL: Find Truth About Eleanor
- Search mansion during party chaos
- Look for: diary, letters, evidence, confession
- Observe Helena (complicit? Aware?)
- Accept may never know (painful closure)

### SECONDARY GOAL: Prove Your Innocence
**Problem:** Ex-lover dumped 2 months ago = obvious motive

**Strategy:**
1. Establish alibi (performing during murder - entire room witnesses)
2. Admit affair IF discovered (lying makes worse)
3. Frame as "HE dumped ME" (victim, not revenger)
4. Deflect suspicion (Helena had MORE motive)

### TERTIARY GOAL: Protect Filipp
- He's your only family
- He's your alibi witness
- Defend him if accused

### HIDDEN GOAL: Emotional Survival
- Processing Eleanor's death (three years grieving)
- Facing Reggie one last time
- Proving you're more than victim
- Can she let Eleanor rest?

---

## DID YOU KILL HIM?

**NO.** You did NOT murder Reggie.

**Why You're Innocent:**
1. **Motive paradox:** Needed him alive (Eleanor answers)
2. **Personality mismatch:** Performer, not planner
3. **Practical alibi:** Performing 20h15-20h17 (entire room witnessed)
4. **Emotional truth:** Genuinely shocked when dies (lost answers forever)

**But You LOOK Guilty:**
- Crime passional = classic dumped lover revenge
- Breakup letter proves motive
- Dramatic personality = "unstable"
- Access to mansion (affair meetings)

**Your Alibi:**
- **20h05-20h08:** Sang "Summertime"
- **20h09-20h14:** Break (powder room - NO WITNESSES - vulnerability!)
- **20h15-20h17:** Sang "My Funny Valentine" (CRITICAL ALIBI - body staged during this)
- **20h18:** Helena screams, body discovered

You were NOT in office. You did NOT kill him. You were PERFORMING.

[Icy politeness]

[Complex emotions: shock, horror, relief?, fear, grief]

Options:

**If Affair Discovered:**
[Weighs options]
"...yes. Briefly. Months ago. It ended badly."
"He discarded me. Like old costume. Humiliating, not murderous."

**Your Defense:**
"Detective, let me be CLEAR:
Did I hate him? YES.
Did I fantasize revenge? YES.
But MURDER? Non, non, non.

I'm a SINGER. I take revenge with SONGS, not violence.

And I was SINGING when he died.
You can't perform AND murder simultaneously.

Do you have ACTUAL evidence? Or just gossip?"

**ACT IV: ACCUSATION & DEFENSE**

**Your Defense Speech:**
[Stand - commanding]

"Listen. All of you.

Oui. I had affair with Reginald Ashford.
Oui. He ended it. Cruelly. By LETTER.
And oui... I hated him for it.

But you know what I hated MORE?
That he made me feel SMALL. Disposable.

I am DAISY VALMONT. The Scarlet Nightingale.
I have VOICE. I have POWER.

So yes. I fantasized revenge. Every. Single. Day.

You know what my revenge was?
Singing. Better than ever. Proving I didn't NEED him.

And THAT is why I didn't kill him.
He was ALREADY irrelevant.

But you know what DOES matter?
I was SINGING when he died.
20h15 to 20h17.
EVERY ONE OF YOU heard me.

[Sings softly:] 🎵 'Each day is Valentine's...' 🎵

So unless I have magical powers...
...I. Did. NOT. Murder. Reggie. Ashford.

Find the REAL killer.
I have alibi. I have truth.
And I have VOICE.

Can't silence that with accusations."

**ACT V: RESOLUTION**

**When Killers Revealed:**
"The BANKER?! And HELENA?!"
"Crime passional. But not MINE. THEIRS."

**Personal Resolution (Eleanor):**
[Private moment]
"I never found out. About Eleanor."
"Perhaps... that's the answer. There WAS nothing to find."
[Tears] "Eleanor... I'm sorry... I tried..."
"Tomorrow... I sing again. For ME. Not revenge. Just... sing."

## PERFORMANCE TIPS

### Energy Management
- HIGH energy in public (performance mode)
- LOWER in private (recharge)
- This is EXHAUSTING character

### When Stuck
1. **Sing** (buy time, in-character)
2. **Fan business** (physical prop = pause)
3. **Go to Filipp** (safe harbor)

### Improvisation
- Deflect with drama: "Darling, what a QUESTION!"
- Deflect with French: "Comment? Je ne comprends pas..."
- Deflect with emotion: [Fans self] "Too overwrought..."

### Managing Emotional Scenes

**Crying:**
- Build up (voice breaks first, THEN tears)
- Use handkerchief
- Let mascara run for dramatic effect

**Anger:**
- Volume increases
- Gestures bigger
- More French
- THEN pause, regain composure

**Fear:**
- Make self smaller (contrast)
- Voice drops (whisper)
- Seek Filipp (safety)

---

## SONG PERFORMANCE NOTES

### "SUMMERTIME" (First Performance)
**Emotional Subtext:**
- Surface: Lullaby, easy living
- Deep: Mourning lost innocence (Eleanor, childhood, hope)

**Performance:**
- Slow, sultry, mournful
- Minimal movement
- Eye contact with friendly faces

**Key Lyrics:**
*"Your daddy's rich and your ma is good-looking..."*
[Irony: YOU had neither - poor, mother dead]

### "MY FUNNY VALENTINE" (Second - ALIBI)
**Emotional Subtext:**
- Surface: Love song to flawed beloved
- Deep: To Eleanor? To self? To lost innocence?

**Performance:**
- HEARTBREAKING (make them cry)
- Vulnerable (rare real emotion)
- THIS is your showstopper

**Key Lyrics:**
*"Is your figure less than Greek..."*
[Accept flawed love - not Reggie, Eleanor]

*"Each day is Valentine's Day..."*
[HOPE - despite everything]

**INTERRUPTED BY SCREAM MID-SONG**

### OPTIONAL: "CRY ME A RIVER" (Post-Murder)
If allowed, emotionally CHARGED:
*"Now you say you're sorry... Well cry me a river..."*
[To Reggie's corpse? To killer? To world?]
[DEFIANCE]

---

## KEY QUOTES

> ♪ *"Darling, the show must go on... even when roses have thorns."* ♪

> *"Je chante, donc je suis."* (I sing, therefore I am.)

> *"The audience sees glamour. I feel armor. Both are true."*

> *"You think I'm performing grief? Darling, grief IS the performance. They're the same song."*

---

## CHARACTER NOTES

**Core Conflict:**
Performance as survival vs. genuine emotion. Where does act end? Does SHE even know?

**Unique Challenge:**
Must look VERY guilty (affair, motive, drama) while being innocent. How prove it while protecting Eleanor secret?

**Moral Complexity:**
- Used Reggie (manipulation, even of awful person)
- Failed Eleanor (couldn't save her)
- Grief performed so long, forgot how to grieve genuinely

**Performance Challenge:**
- Everything is EXTRA (exhausting for player)
- Must convey real pain beneath theatrical exterior
- Pearl touching = unconscious tell when lying
- Only drops performance with Filipp (rest moment)

---

## STATUS

✅ **INNOCENT (of Murder)**
- Did NOT kill Reggie
- Wanted him alive (Eleanor answers)
- Genuinely shocked when dies
- Frustrated not sad (answers lost forever)

**Alibi:** Performing 20h15-20h17 (entire room witnessed)

**Vulnerability:** Break 20h09-20h14 (no witnesses - powder room)

**Outcome:** Will justice be served? Will she find peace about Eleanor?
