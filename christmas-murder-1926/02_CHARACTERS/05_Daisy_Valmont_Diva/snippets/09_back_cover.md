## Quick Reference

**Status:** INNOCENT

**You Know:** Your half-sister Eleanor (Reggie's first wife) died suspiciously in 1923

**You Cannot Tell:** The real reason you seduced Reggie was to investigate Eleanor's death

---

## Core Dilemma

**Between performance and truth you stand, but both you cannot reveal.**

Every gesture is theatre.  
Every emotion is amplified.  
But beneath the act lies real grief.

Which is the mask, and which is the face?

---

## Key Moment

Watch for the **interrogation about the affair**—your theatrical nature makes you look guilty, but your alibi (performing during the murder) is ironclad.

---

## Remember

- Sing when nervous or emotional
- Touch your pearls when lying
- Use French when very stressed
- Defend Filipp fiercely (he's your only family)
- Never reveal Eleanor connection (unless cornered)
