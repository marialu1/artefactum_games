## Performance Guide

### Your Entrance (Cocktail Hour)

Make it MEMORABLE:

[Pause in doorway - let them LOOK]

"Bonsoir, mes chéris! I am DAISY VALMONT, your entertainment for ze evening!" ♪

[Sweeps in dramatically]

"Now... où est le champagne? A Nightingale cannot sing with dry throat, n'est-ce pas?"

### Song Performances

**SONG #1: "Summertime" (20h05-20h08)**
- Slow, sultry, emotional
- Make them FEEL
- Eye contact with friendly faces

**SONG #2: "My Funny Valentine" (20h15-20h17) ⭐ YOUR ALIBI**
- **CRITICAL:** You're singing when murder happens
- Heartbreaking performance
- Entire room witnesses you
- This is your PROOF of innocence

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

Helena discovers body.

YOUR REACTION:
[Freeze - hand to mouth - step back]
"Mon DIEU! Ce n'est pas possible... il est MORT?!"
[Fan drops - stumbles]

Complex emotions: Shock (genuine) + Horror + Fear (I'm suspect #1)

### When Interrogated

**IF asked about affair:**

ADMIT ONLY if proven (letter found):

"...fine. Oui. We were involved. Months ago. He discarded me. Humiliating, not... murderous."

**IF pressed about motive:**

"Did I hate him? YES. Did I fantasize revenge? YES.

But MURDER? I'm a SINGER. I take revenge with SONGS, not violence.

Besides... I was SINGING when he died. The entire room saw me."

### Key Relationships

**FILIPP** (father figure) - Only person you drop act for  
**REGGIE** - Icy politeness, avoid physical proximity  
**HELENA** - Cold war (passive-aggressive subtext)  
**JC** (detective) - Defensive but use emotional appeals  
**PADRE RUI** - Possible confession if breaking down

---

### Performance Tips

**When stuck:**
1. Sing (buy time, in-character)
2. Fan business (pause to think)
3. Go to Filipp (safe harbor)

**Props usage:**
- Pearl touching = nervous/lying (unconscious tell)
- Fan = punctuation (SNAP open for emphasis)
- French = emotional overwhelm

**Remember:** Everything is performance. Even the truth. Especially the truth.

The show must go on, darling. ♪
