## 📌 Notes

**Character Complexity:** High (theatrical performance + deep secrets)

**Player Challenge:** Balance dramatic performance with genuine emotion

**GM Note:** Daisy is innocent but LOOKS very guilty. Her alibi is solid (performing during murder) but her motive is obvious (dumped mistress). The Eleanor subplot is her real secret.

**Performance Tip:** Everything is theatre. Even the truth. Especially the truth.
