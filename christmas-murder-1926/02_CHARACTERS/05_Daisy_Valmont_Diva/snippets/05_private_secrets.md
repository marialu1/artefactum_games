## Secret #1: The Affair (January-August 1926)

**6-month affair with Reggie Ashford** - but NOT for love.

**How it began:** New Year's Eve 1925, Cotton Club. He sent champagne to your dressing room. You accepted... but strategically. This was your chance to get close to him.

**The truth:** You NEVER loved him. Found him boring, vain, mediocre. The affair was **INFILTRATION**—access to his mansion, his papers, his life.

**Why?** You were searching for evidence about **Eleanor's death** (his first wife, died 1923).

**August 1926 - The Breakup:** He dumped you by LETTER. Not even face-to-face.

*"It's been delightful, but I must focus on my marriage now. Don't contact me again. - R."*

**Your reaction:** RAGE. Not heartbreak—RAGE. Discarded like garbage. And worse: mission FAILED. Six months, no proof.

You kept the letter (ripped up in fury, then taped back together).

## Secret #2: Eleanor Was Your Half-Sister

**Eleanor Ashford** (Reggie's first wife, died October 1923) was your **HALF-SISTER.**

**Shared mother:** Margot Beaumont (died 1911, tuberculosis).

**Your childhood:**
- Eleanor 5 years older (protective big sister)  
- Raised together in poverty (Harlem)
- Mother died when you were 13
- Separated: Eleanor went to work, you to orphanage
- Lost contact for years

**1916:** Eleanor married Reggie. Promised to reconnect with you. Never did. (He forbade it—said a "cabaret singer sister" wasn't appropriate.)

**You never saw her again.**

## Secret #3: Eleanor's Death & Tonight's Mission

**Two weeks before Eleanor died (October 1923), you received a letter:**

*"Dearest Daisy,*

*Reginald forbade contact, but I must write. I'm frightened.*

*He's been threatening. Last night he said 'accidents happen to inconvenient wives.'*

*If something happens to me... know it wasn't an accident.*

*I love you. I'm sorry.*

*- E."*

**Three days later:** Eleanor died. "Pneumonia." No autopsy. Body cremated.

**You KNEW:** Reggie killed her. But no proof. No one would believe a cabaret singer.

**Tonight's REAL mission:**

The affair wasn't romance. It was **INVESTIGATION.**

You seduced Reggie to:
1. Access the mansion (search for Eleanor evidence)
2. Get close to him (force confession?)
3. Find PROOF he murdered your sister

**Six months:** Found NOTHING.

**Tonight:** Party = LAST CHANCE. Final access to mansion. One more attempt to find the truth.

**The cruel irony:** Now Reggie's dead. You'll NEVER know what really happened to Eleanor.

**How to manage these secrets:**

- **NEVER** reveal Eleanor connection voluntarily
- **IF** pressed about affair: admit ONLY if proven (letter found)
- Frame as "HE dumped ME" (victim, not revenger)
- Protect the Eleanor mission at all costs
