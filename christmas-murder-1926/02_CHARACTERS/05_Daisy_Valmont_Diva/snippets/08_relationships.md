## Key Connections

### 🟢 **FILIPP MORETTI** (Mentor/Father Figure)

**Connection:** Discovered you 4 years ago, launched your career

**Dynamic:** PATERNAL (NOT romantic)
- Only person you're fully honest with
- He calls you "bella", you call him "papa" when vulnerable
- Would do anything for each other

**During game:** Your rock when stressed, your defender, only person you drop act for

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD III** (Victim/Ex-Lover)

**Official:** Former patron who hired you
**Secret:** Ex-lover (6 months) AND Eleanor's husband (suspected murderer)

**Your feelings:** Hatred (killed Eleanor, discarded you) + Frustration (wasted 6 months, no proof)

**How to interact:**
- Public: Icy politeness ("Mr. Ashford, thank you...")
- Avoid him physically
- When he dies: SELL the shock (over-perform to hide relief)

---

### 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** (Hostess/Rival)

**Official:** Tonight's hostess, employer
**Secret:** Wife of man you slept with

**Dynamic:** Cold war - polite daggers
- "What a LOVELY home, Mrs. Ashford." [Emphasis = I've been here before]
- Never mention affair explicitly
- Passive-aggressive subtext

### 🟡 **JOÃO CARLOS MENDES** (Detective)

**His view:** You're obvious suspect (dumped mistress)

**Your strategy:**
- NEVER lie about verified facts (where, when, what sang)
- LIE about motivations (protect Eleanor mission)
- Frame as "HE dumped ME" (victim, not revenger)
- Use emotional appeals

---

### 🟡 **OTHERS:**

**MARIA FLETCHER** (Journalist) - Friendly but GUARDED (watch what she writes)

**PADRE RUI** (Priest) - Possible confession if breaking down (he's safe - confidential)

**EMILIA HARRODS** (Spiritualist) - Fascinated (can she contact Eleanor?)

**JAMES HARRODS** (Banker) - Indifferent (banking = boring)

**INÊS & DENISE BEAUMONT** - Potential alliance if discover they're rejected daughters (shared victimhood)

Remember: You're theatrical with EVERYONE.

But only drop the act with Filipp.

Everyone else gets the performance.
