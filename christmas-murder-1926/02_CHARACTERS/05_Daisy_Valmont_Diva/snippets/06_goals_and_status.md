- **YOUR ALIBI:** Performing during murder (20h15-20h17)
  - Entire room witnessed you singing
  - Can't be two places at once!

## Your Status: INNOCENT

**You did NOT murder Reginald Ashford.**

### Why You're Innocent

1. **Needed him ALIVE** (Eleanor answers, confession)
   - Dead Reggie = dead answers (self-defeating)

2. **Personality mismatch**
   - You're PERFORMER, not PLANNER
   - You're EMOTIONAL, not CALCULATED

3. **SOLID ALIBI**
   - **Performing 20h15-20h17** (during body staging)
   - Entire room witnessed you
   - Physical impossibility

### But You LOOK Guilty Because...

- Motive is OBVIOUS (dumped lover's revenge)
- You're dramatic (over-the-top reactions = suspicious)
- Access to mansion (been there before during affair)
- Breakup letter exists (proves motive)

### Your Defense

"Did I hate him? YES. He used me, discarded me, humiliated me.

Did I fantasize revenge? YES. Every woman he wronged probably did.

But MURDER? Non, non, non.

I'm a SINGER. I take revenge with SONGS, not violence.

Besides... I was SINGING when he died. You can't perform AND murder simultaneously, chéri.

Now. Do you have ACTUAL evidence? Or just... gossip?"
