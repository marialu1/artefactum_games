**Secret Reality:** Ex-lover (6-month affair, January-August 1926). Reggie dumped her cruelly in August. But the affair was STRATEGIC—she seduced him to infiltrate his life and investigate Eleanor Ashford's death... because Eleanor was her HALF-SISTER.

**Core Conflict:** You LOOK so guilty (dumped mistress = obvious crime passional motive), but you're innocent. How do you prove it while protecting your REAL secret (Eleanor)?
