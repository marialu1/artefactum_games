## CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is Daisy Vermont?**

**In Three Sentences:**

Daisy Vermont is a **stunning 28-year-old cabaret singer** at Harlem's Cotton Club, known as "The Scarlet Nightingale" for her voice that "makes men weep." Beneath her **theatrical, dramatic exterior** lies a woman on a **secret mission**: she seduced Reggie Ashford not for love, but to **infiltrate his life and investigate her half-sister Eleanor's suspicious death** three years ago. Though she's **INNOCENT of Reggie's murder**, her affair with him (ended cruelly two months ago) makes her the **most obvious suspect** - a crime passional red herring wrapped in feathers and sequins.

### **Core Paradox**

**"Performance as Survival"**

Everything is theater - tears, laughter, seduction, grief. BUT beneath the performance is REAL pain (abandoned as child, half-sister dead, rejected by Reggie). Question: Where does the act end and real emotion begin? Does SHE even know anymore?

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I LOOK so guilty (affair, motive, drama queen), but I'm innocent! How do I prove it while protecting my REAL secret (Eleanor)?!"*

## PERSONALITY

### TEMPERAMENT

**Core Traits:**

1. **DRAMATIC (Theatre is Life)**
   - Every gesture, word, entrance is PERFORMANCE
   - Sees life as stage - always "on"
   - Emotions expressed grandly (even when genuine)
   - Cannot help performing even mundane moments

2. **EXPRESSIVE (Wears Heart on Sleeve... Or Does She?)**
   - Emotions big, visible, theatrical
   - Laughs loudly, cries dramatically, loves passionately
   - BUT: Is it real or act? Even SHE doesn't always know
   - Defense mechanism: perform pain so don't have to FEEL it

3. **ROMANTIC (But Disillusioned)**
   - Believes in grand love stories (grew up on opera/film)
   - Reggie betrayal shattered illusions
   - Still vulnerable to romantic gestures
   - Cynical BUT yearns for fairy tale

4. **LOYAL (To Those Who Earned It)**
   - Filipp = father figure, would die for him
   - Eleanor's memory = sacred (avenging her)
   - Once someone proves loyal, she's fiercely protective
   - Betrayal = unforgivable (Reggie learned this)

5. **SURVIVOR (Tough Beneath Glamour)**
   - Orphan, grew up poor, fought for success
   - Singing = escape poverty, not just art
   - Uses charm/sexuality strategically (survival tool)
   - Glamour is ARMOR (can't hurt me if dazzled)

### EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE

**Surface (What Others See):**
- Vivacious, flirty, dramatic, attention-seeking
- Laughs easily, cries theatrically, sings constantly
- Life of the party (or emotional hurricane)

**Depth (What's Hidden):**
- Loneliness (never truly known/seen)
- Grief (Eleanor, mother she never knew, Reggie's cruelty)
- Fear (what if never finds love/acceptance?)
- Determination (WILL discover Eleanor's truth)

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- **Performance:** Act so don't have to feel
- **Singing:** Emotions too big for words
- **Seduction:** Control via desire (others want her = power)
- **Humor:** Laugh so don't cry

### SPEECH PATTERNS

**Vocabulary:**
- Theatrical terms ("darling," "sweetness," "fabulous," "dreadful")
- French phrases (affectation, glamour): "mon chéri," "c'est magnifique," "quelle horreur"
- Singing terminology when nervous/excited
- Exaggerated adjectives (everything is DIVINE or TERRIBLE)

**Cadence:**
- Melodic, musical (even speech has rhythm)
- Dramatic pauses (for effect)
- Switches to singing mid-sentence when emotional
- Volume varies wildly (whisper to shout in seconds)

**Signature Phrases:**
- ♪ "Darling, this is simply TOO MUCH!" ♪
- "The show must go on, n'est-ce pas?"
- ♪ (Hums melody instead of answering) ♪
- "A lady never tells... but I'm no lady." [Winks]
- "In opera, this is when someone dies..." [When tense]

**When Lying:**
- OVER-performs (too dramatic even for her)
- Touches pearls nervously
- Sings more (distraction)
- French increases (verbal smokescreen)

**When Genuine:**
- Voice drops (quieter, vulnerable)
- Music stops (rare silence)
- Direct eye contact (not performing)
- Simple words (no theatrical flourish)

### MANNERISMS

**Physical Tells:**

1. **Pearl Touching** (Nervous/Lying)
   - Fingers go to pearls at throat
   - Obsessive touch when stressed
   - Unconscious self-soothing

2. **Fan Flourishing** (Dramatic Emphasis)
   - Opens fan with SNAP for punctuation
   - Hides face when "shocked" (coy)
   - Waves vigorously when hot/flustered

3. **Singing Responses** (Emotional Overwhelm)
   - Instead of answering verbally: ♪ hums or sings reply ♪
   - When very nervous: entire sentences sung
   - Comic relief BUT also genuine coping

4. **Grand Gestures** (Theatre Mode)
   - Arms sweep wide
   - Hand to forehead (melodrama)
   - Dramatic poses (learned from stage)
   - Takes up space (performance needs audience)

5. **Language Switching** (Emotional Regulation)
   - English = controlled
   - French = VERY emotional or nervous
   - Mix of both = moderate stress

**Habitual Actions:**
- Reapplies lipstick compulsively (armor maintenance)
- Adjusts hair/dress constantly (presentation perfection)
- Smokes with cigarette holder (glamour prop)
- Hums when thinking/walking/existing

**Stress Responses:**

## PRIVATE SECRETS

### 🔴 SECRET #1: THE AFFAIR

**TIMELINE: January-August 1926**

#### **How It Began (January 1926)**

**The Meeting:**
- New Year's Eve party, Cotton Club (December 31, 1925)
- Reggie attended (regular patron, bored married man)
- Daisy performed "Summertime" (captivated him)
- He sent champagne to dressing room after show

**First Encounter:**
- Note with champagne: *"Voice of an angel. Join me?"*
- Daisy hesitated (married men = trouble)
- BUT thought of Eleanor (this is HIM - Eleanor's husband)
- Accepted invitation (strategic decision disguised as flirtation)

**Courtship (January-February 1926):**
- Reggie pursued aggressively (flowers daily, gifts, attention)
- Daisy played coy (strategic, building trust)
- He: "Leave Helena for you... eventually..."
- She: Pretended to believe (needed access to his life)

**Affair Consummated (February 14, 1926):**
- Valentine's Day (symbolic, he planned it)
- Hotel suite, champagne, roses (textbook seduction)
- Daisy: performed desire (good actress)
- Reggie: genuinely infatuated (conquest + ego)

#### **The Affair (February-August 1926 - 6 Months)**

**Nature of Relationship:**

**Reggie's Perspective:**
- Trophy mistress (beautiful, young, talented)
- Ego boost (makes him feel virile, desirable)
- Secret thrill (affair = rebellion against boring marriage)
- Control (enjoyed power over her career/life)

**Daisy's REAL Motives:**
- **NOT love** (never loved him, found him boring/vain)
- **Infiltration:** Access mansion, his papers, inner circle
- **Investigation:** Search for evidence Eleanor's death wasn't natural
- **Eleanor's letter (1923):** *"If something happens to me... it wasn't accident."*

**Pattern:**
- Meetings: Hotel rooms (discrete), occasionally his office (when Helena away)
- Frequency: 2-3x per week (enough to maintain access)
- Gifts: He showered her (jewelry, dresses, cash) - she accepted (part of role)
- Affection: He was genuinely attached; she PERFORMED attachment

**What Daisy Discovered (Or Tried To):**
- Mansion access: 5-6 times (when Helena visiting family)
- Searched: Library, office, bedroom (looking for Eleanor evidence)
- Found: NOTHING conclusive (Reggie too careful? Nothing there?)
- Frustration: 6 months wasted on dead-end?

**Emotional Reality:**

Did Daisy develop ANY feelings?
- **Physical:** No (found him mediocre lover, too self-absorbed)
- **Emotional:** No attachment (pity sometimes - sad, vain man)
- **Guilt:** YES (using someone even if they're awful = still using)
- **Relief when ended:** Honestly? Yes (exhausting to pretend)

#### **The Breakup (August 1926)**

**What Happened:**

**August 15, 1926:**
Received LETTER (not even in person - coward):

*"Daisy,*

*It's been delightful, but I must focus on my marriage now.*

*Helena suspects, and it's becoming tedious.*

*Don't contact me again.*

*I wish you well in your career.*

*- R."*

**Daisy's Reaction:**

**Immediate:**
- Rage (not heartbreak - RAGE)
- Not because loved him (didn't)
- Because: DISCARDED like old prop
- AND: Mission FAILED (no Eleanor answers)
- Humiliation (used her then threw away)

**That Night:**
- Went to Cotton Club
- Cried in dressing room (Filipp found her)
- He: "Want me to break his face?"
- She: "Not worth it, papa." (Called him papa = rare vulnerability)
- Performed anyway (show must go on)
- Sang "Cry Me A River" with VENOM (audience felt it)

**Aftermath (August-December 1926):**
- Kept letter (why? Evidence? Reminder? Rage fuel?)
- Ripped it up (fury) then TAPED back together (couldn't destroy proof)
- Fantasized revenge (public humiliation, exposure, ruin)
- BUT: Filipp calmed her ("Not worth prison, bella")
- Party invitation (December): ONE LAST CHANCE (access mansion, find Eleanor truth)

#### **Current Feelings About Reggie**

**Complex Mix:**
- **Hatred:** How he discarded her (object, not person)
- **Frustration:** Wasted 6 months, no answers
- **Guilt:** Used him (even if he's awful, still manipulation)
- **Relief:** Free of pretending desire
- **Determination:** Party = final attempt Eleanor truth

**Did She Want Him Dead?**
- **Fantasized?** Yes (rage fantasies, normal)
- **Seriously planned?** NO (murder ≠ performance)
- **Capable?** Emotionally yes, practically no (too public, too risky, too FINAL)
- **Reaction to death:** COMPLICATED (relief + fear + lost answers)

### 🔴 SECRET #2: ELEANOR WAS HER HALF-SISTER

**THE FAMILY CONNECTION**

#### **Shared Mother: Margot Beaumont**

**Margot's Story (1870-1911):**

Margot Beaumont (maiden name):
- Born 1870, working-class French-American family
- Beautiful, charming, ambitious
- Dreamed of escaping poverty via "good match"

**First Relationship → Eleanor (Born 1893):**
- Margot 23, affair with Thomas Whitfield (middle-class clerk)
- Pregnant → Thomas abandoned her
- Gave birth alone: **Eleanor** (May 1893)
- Kept Eleanor (struggled, but loved her)

**Second Relationship → Daisy (Born 1898):**
- Margot 28, affair with unknown man (possibly musician?)
- Pregnant again → man disappeared
- Gave birth: **Daisy** (April 1898)
- Now TWO daughters, deeper poverty

**The Sisters (1898-1911):**
- Eleanor 5 years older (protective big sister)
- Daisy baby/toddler (adored Eleanor)
- Margot worked multiple jobs (cleaning, sewing, cooking)
- Poor but LOVING home (music, laughter, closeness)

**1911: Margot's Death + Separation**

**Margot died:** Tuberculosis (age 41, common working-class death)

**What Happened to Sisters:**

**Eleanor (18 years old):**
- Old enough to "age out" of orphan care
- Found work as maid (eventually)
- Eventually: Governess (educated herself)
- Met Reggie Ashford (she was governess at relative's house)
- He courted her (she was beautiful, educated, refinement)
- **Married 1916** (Eleanor 23, Reggie 25)

**Daisy (13 years old):**
- Too young to work legally
- Sent to orphanage (St. Mary's, Manhattan)
- Miserable (institutional, cold, nothing like home)
- Fostered briefly (3 families, ages 13-16, all difficult)
- **Aged out 1916** (18 years old, same year Eleanor married)

#### **The Separation**

**Why Didn't They Stay Together?**

1. **Age gap:** Eleanor 18 (legal adult), Daisy 13 (minor)
2. **Economics:** Eleanor couldn't support Daisy financially
3. **System:** Orphanages separated siblings routinely (policy)
4. **Eleanor's guilt:** Promised "I'll come back for you" (never could)

**Contact After Separation:**

**1911-1916 (Ages 13-18 Daisy):**
- Eleanor visited orphanage: 4 times total over 5 years
- Infrequent (working long hours, saving money, survival)
- Daisy: treasured visits, waited desperately
- Last visit: 1916 (Eleanor announced engagement to Reggie)

**Eleanor's Wedding (1916):**
- Eleanor to Daisy: "When I'm settled, you'll visit! We'll be together again!"
- Daisy (18, just aged out): "Promise?"
- Eleanor: "I promise." [Hugged her] "You're my only family."

**The Promise Broken:**

After wedding, Eleanor wrote once:

*"Dearest Daisy,*

*Reginald doesn't want... complications from my past.*

*He says a cabaré singer sister isn't appropriate for his family.*

*Please understand. I'll write when I can.*

*With love, E."*

**Daisy never heard from her again.**

#### **Daisy's Feelings About Eleanor**

**1916-1923 (Ages 18-25):**
- **Hurt:** Eleanor chose Reggie over her
- **Anger:** Abandoned AGAIN (Margot death, now Eleanor)
- **Longing:** Only family, desperately wanted connection
- **Understanding:** Eleanor trapped in gilded cage (Reggie's control)

**No Contact for 7 YEARS.**

Daisy assumed Eleanor forgot her, moved on, chosen wealth over family.

---

### 🔴 SECRET #3: ELEANOR'S DEATH & THE LETTER

**THE LETTER (October 1923)**

#### **Two Weeks Before Eleanor Died**

**Daisy received letter** (forwarded via Cotton Club - Eleanor tracked her down via newspaper review):

*"Dearest Daisy,*

*Please forgive my silence. Reginald forbade contact.*

*But I must write now. I'm frightened.*

*He's been different lately. Angry. Threatening.*

*Last night, he said 'accidents happen to inconvenient wives.'*

*I don't know what to do. I have no one else.*

*If something happens to me... know it wasn't an accident.*

*Please. Remember this.*

*I love you. I'm sorry I wasn't the sister you deserved.*

*E."*

#### **Daisy's Reaction (October 1923)**

**Immediate:**
- PANIC (Eleanor in danger!)
- Wanted to go to mansion IMMEDIATELY
- Filipp stopped her: "You'll make it worse. You're nobody to them."

**Plan:**
- Write back: "Leave him. Come to me. I'll protect you."
- Sent letter to mansion

**Too Late:**

**Three days later:**

Newspaper headline: *"MRS. ELEANOR ASHFORD, SOCIALITE WIFE, DIES OF PNEUMONIA"*

Obituary:
- Tragic sudden illness
- Complications from influenza
- Husband devastated
- Private funeral

**Daisy's Devastation:**

- Sister DEAD
- Warning ignored/too late
- Guilt (should have acted sooner)
- Conviction: **REGGIE MURDERED HER**

#### **Grief & Rage (October-December 1923)**

**Daisy's State:**
- Couldn't perform (voice broken by grief)
- Drank heavily (drowning pain)
- Filipp: kept her employed despite absence (paternal love)
- Cried every night (only family, gone)

**Rage:**
- Letter said "accidents happen"
- Then Eleanor dies "pneumonia"
- TOO CONVENIENT
- **Daisy KNEW**: Reggie killed her

**But No Proof:**
- No autopsy (wealthy family, private doctor)
- Body cremated (no evidence)
- Letter: not proof of murder (just fear)
- Daisy: powerless (who'd believe cabaret singer vs. wealthy man?)

#### **The Plan Forms (January-August 1926)**

**Two Years Later:**

Daisy recovered (sort of):
- Grief scabbed over (still raw underneath)
- Career resumed (performing = escape)
- BUT: Eleanor's death haunted her

**New Year's Eve 1925:**

Reggie attended Cotton Club performance.

**Lightbulb moment:**

"He's here. He's alone. He's interested.

What if... I seduce him?

What if... I get close?

What if... I FIND PROOF?"

**The Infiltration Affair (January-August 1926):**

NOT romance. NOT attraction.

**REVENGE. TRUTH. JUSTICE FOR ELEANOR.**

Daisy seduced Reggie to:
1. Access mansion (search for evidence)
2. Get close to him (extract confession?)
3. Discover what happened to Eleanor
4. Possibly... expose him? Ruin him? Make him pay?

**Result:**

Six months of pretending desire for a man she loathed.

Six months of searching.

Six months of finding NOTHING.

Then... he dumped her (August).

Mission: FAILED.

Or... was it?

---

### 🔴 SECRET #4: THE CURRENT MISSION

**PARTY = LAST CHANCE**

#### **Why Accept Performance Invitation?**

**Officially:**
- $75 (good money)
- Exposure (wealthy guests = networking)
- Professional opportunity

**REALLY:**
- **Final access to mansion** (last chance search)
- **Reggie present** (possible confrontation/confession)
- **Helena present** (does SHE know Eleanor truth?)
- **Chaos = cover** (party distraction = search opportunity)

#### **The Plan (December 24, 1926)**

**Stage 1: Perform**
- Sing 3 songs (professional, expected)
- Establish presence (everyone sees/hears me)
- Create alibis (visible during crimes)

**Stage 2: Search**
- During party chaos (dinner, drinks, movement)
- Excuse: "Powder room," "Fresh air," "Lost earring"
- Target: Office, library, bedroom (anywhere Eleanor lived)
- Look for: Diary, letters, evidence, ANYTHING

**Stage 3: Confront?**
- If finds proof → expose Reggie publicly?
- If finds nothing → confront him privately? (desperate confession attempt)
- If neither → accept defeat, mourn Eleanor, move on

#### **Emotional State Arriving Party**

**Surface (Performance):**
- Vivacious, charming, professional
- "Delighted to be here, darlings!"
- Smiles, waves, sings

**Interior (Truth):**
- Anxious (last chance)
- Grief (Eleanor would be here if alive)
- Rage (Reggie in THAT room, living, while Eleanor dead)
- Determination (WILL find answers tonight)

**Complex:**
- Sees Reggie: hatred + ghost of pretend-love + mission
- Sees Helena: pity (you're married to murderer) + jealousy (she has life Eleanor wanted)
- Sees mansion: Eleanor's home (haunted for Daisy)

## RELATIONSHIPS

### 🎭 RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL CHARACTERS

*(10 characters mapped with interaction dynamics)*

---

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD III** *(Victim/Ex-Lover)*

**Official Connection:** Former client/patron who hired her to perform

**Secret Reality:** Ex-lover (6 months), ELEANOR'S HUSBAND, suspected murderer

**Daisy's True Feelings:**
- **Hatred:** Killed Eleanor (suspected), discarded Daisy cruelly
- **Disgust:** Vain, boring, mediocre man who thinks he's god
- **Frustration:** Wasted 6 months, found no proof
- **Fear:** Does he suspect why she REALLY seduced him?

**Dynamic:**
- **Public:** Professional courtesy (barely)
  - "Mr. Ashford, thank you for engaging my services" [Cold smile]
- **Private:** Venom thinly veiled
  - "You look well, Reggie. Marriage agrees with you." [Acid tone]
- **When Alone (If happens):** Full confrontation possible
  - "Did you love her? Eleanor? Or was she just another inconvenience?"

**When He's Murdered:**
- **Public Reaction:** Theatrical shock/grief (performance)
  - "Mon Dieu! How TERRIBLE!" [Clutches pearls, gasps]
- **Private Feelings:** Relief (dead = can't hurt anyone) + Frustration (answers died with him)
- **Complication:** Now VERY suspicious (motive obvious = dumped mistress)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Avoid him physically (stand across room)
- If forced to speak: icy politeness
- Never alone with him willingly (too dangerous emotionally)
- When he dies: SELL the shock (over-perform to hide relief)

---

### 🔴 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Hostess/Rival/Victim?)*

**Official Connection:** Tonight's hostess, employer for performance

**Secret Reality:** Current wife of man Daisy slept with 6 months

**Daisy's Feelings:**
- **Guilt:** Betrayed her (affair with husband, even if strategic)
- **Pity:** Trapped with Reggie (must be miserable)
- **Jealousy:** Has legitimacy/status Daisy never will
- **Wariness:** Does Helena KNOW about affair? (Suspects yes)

**Helena's Feelings (Suspected):**
- **Suspicion:** Knows or suspects affair
- **Contempt:** Cabaret singer = "low class"
- **Threat:** Daisy = beautiful, young, everything Helena isn't

**Dynamic:**
- **Cold War:** Polite daggers disguised as courtesy
  - DAISY: "What a LOVELY home, Mrs. Ashford." [Emphasis = I've been here before]
  - HELENA: "How kind. I trust you'll keep to the schedule." [Stay in your place]

**Example Exchange:**

HELENA: "Miss Valmont. I trust your... preparations are complete?"

DAISY: "Mais oui, Madame. I'm ALWAYS prepared." [Smiles sweetly]

HELENA: "Excellent. We value... professionalism." [Eyes narrow]

DAISY: "As do I, chérie. The show must go on, n'est-ce pas?" [Holds gaze]

[Tension thick enough to cut]

**When Reggie's Murdered:**
- **Daisy watches Helena carefully:** (Did SHE do it? Wife = prime suspect too)
- **Possible alliance?** (Both wronged by Reggie... but can't trust each other)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Avoid direct conflict (explosive)
- Passive-aggressive comments (war via subtext)
- Never mention affair explicitly (unspoken understanding)
- Watch her reactions closely (she's hiding something too)

---

### 🟢 **FILIPP MORETTI** *(Mentor/Protector/Father Figure)*

**Connection:** Discovered Daisy 4 years ago, launched her career

**Relationship:** **PATERNAL (NOT romantic)**

**Daisy's Feelings:**
- **Love:** First person who believed in her (saved her)
- **Gratitude:** Everything she has = because of him
- **Trust:** Only person she's fully honest with
- **Protection:** Would do anything for him (reciprocal)

**Filipp's Feelings:**
- **Paternal love:** Sees her as daughter (never romantic)
- **Pride:** Her success = his success (artist he shaped)
- **Protection:** Would literally kill for her (probably not metaphorical)

**History:**

**1922 (4 years ago):**
- Daisy singing in third-rate bar (Harlem dive)
- Voice incredible but wasted (no training, no exposure)
- Filipp heard her, saw potential
- Offered spot at Cotton Club (his venue)

**Transformation:**
- Voice training (funded by Filipp)
- Stage presence coaching (how to OWN room)
- Wardrobe (created "Scarlet Nightingale" persona)
- Within year: rising star

**Current:**
- Mentor/mentee but deeper (father/daughter)
- She calls him "papa" when vulnerable (rare)
- He calls her "bella" (beautiful, affectionate)

**He Knows:**
- About Reggie affair (she told him after breakup)
- About Eleanor death (she confided eventually)
- About tonight's REAL mission (he warned her: "Careful, bella. Revenge is expensive.")

**Dynamic Examples:**

**Supportive:**
FILIPP: "Nervous, bella?"
DAISY: "Me? Never!" [Laughs, but he sees through it]
FILIPP: "You shine tonight. Make them weep." [Kisses her forehead]

**Protective:**
[Someone insults Daisy]
FILIPP: [Steps between] "Careful with your words, amico."
DAISY: [Touches his arm] "Papa, I can handle—"
FILIPP: "No one disrespects my Nightingale."

**Honest:**
DAISY: "What if I never find out what happened to Eleanor?"
FILIPP: "Then you let her rest, cara. The dead don't need vengeance. You need life."

**When Reggie's Murdered:**
- Filipp = Daisy's alibi (she's performing when it happens)
- Filipp = her defender ("She was singing! I SAW her!")
- Filipp = her anchor (grounds her when she panics)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Relax around him (only person she drops performance for)
- Physical affection allowed (hugs, forehead kisses, arm links)
- Seeks his approval unconsciously
- Protects him too (if accused, SHE defends ferociously)

---

### 🟡 **MARIA FLETCHER** *(Journalist/Potential Ally OR Threat)*

**Connection:** Journalist covering high society, both artistic women

**Potential Relationship:** Complicated (could be friend OR exposer)

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Wariness:** Writer = observes EVERYTHING (dangerous)
- **Interest:** Intelligent woman, similar outsider status?
- **Fear:** If Maria digs too deep... Eleanor secret exposed

**Maria's Perspective (Likely):**
- **Fascination:** Daisy = perfect character study (performance vs. truth)
- **Suspicion:** Too dramatic to be ONLY act (hiding something)
- **Professional:** Possible story here (cabaret singer + murdered millionaire)

**Potential Dynamics:**

**Friendly Approach:**
MARIA: "You have incredible stage presence, Miss Valmont."
DAISY: "Oh darling, you're too kind!" [Genuine smile - appreciates artist recognizing artist]
MARIA: "I'd love to interview you sometime. Your rise fascinates me."
DAISY: [Wariness kicks in] "Perhaps... when schedules align..." [Vague]

**Investigative Approach:**
MARIA: [Taking notes] "You performed here before, yes?"
DAISY: [Defensive] "Professionally, chérie. Always professionally." [Pointed]
MARIA: "Of course. Though Mr. Ashford must have admired your work. Three performances in one year?"
DAISY: [Tense] "He appreciated... music." [Careful]

**Possible Alliance:**
- IF Maria reveals HER grudge against Reggie (career destroyed)
- COULD bond over "Reggie ruined us both"
- Mutual aid: Maria's investigation skills + Daisy's insider access

**Possible Threat:**
- IF Maria uncovers affair → public scandal
- IF Maria discovers Eleanor truth → complicates murder case
- Daisy must manage information carefully (what to reveal, when)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Friendly but GUARDED (don't overshare)
- Deflect personal questions with performance (sing, gesture, distract)
- Watch what she writes down (notes = evidence)
- IF accused: Maria could be character witness ("She was performing! I saw!")

---

### 🟡 **JOÃO CARLOS MENDES** *(Detective - Neutral Professional)*

**Connection:** Hired by Helena as... investigator? Security? Unclear role

**Relationship:** Professional wariness (he investigates, she's suspect)

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Respect:** Professional investigator (competent)
- **Fear:** Will he uncover affair? Eleanor connection? (Dangerous)
- **Performance:** Must stay in character around him (he SEES through masks)

**JC's Perspective (Likely):**
- **Suspicious:** Dumped mistress = OBVIOUS motive
- **Professional:** But evidence > assumption (thorough investigator)
- **Sympathy?** Maybe sees her as victim of Reggie too (complicated)

**Dynamic:**

**Interrogation (Inevitable):**

JC: "Miss Valmont. Where were you 20h10-20h18?"
DAISY: "Performing, chéri! I was SINGING!" [Dramatic gesture]
JC: [Writes note] "Witnesses confirm?"
DAISY: "The entire room! I'm hard to miss, detective." [Gestures to dress]
JC: "And your relationship with Mr. Ashford was...?"
DAISY: [Pause - careful] "Professional. He hired me occasionally."
JC: [Looks up] "Only professional?"
DAISY: [Meets eyes] "What else would it be?" [Lie - but sells it]

**If Pressed:**

JC: "I have information suggesting closer connection..."
DAISY: [Defensive] "People gossip, detective. I'm a woman in cabaré. They ALWAYS gossip."
JC: "So you deny any... intimacy?"
DAISY: [Weighs options - partial truth?] "We were... friendly. He appreciated my art. That is ALL."

**If Evidence Presented (Breakup Letter):**

JC: [Shows letter] "Explain this."
DAISY: [Goes pale - then DRAMATIC] "Mon Dieu! Where did you—"
JC: "Found in his office. You were lovers."
DAISY: [Drops act - vulnerable] "It ended MONTHS ago. He discarded me. I was... heartbroken."
JC: "Heartbroken enough to kill?"
DAISY: [Fierce] "Heartbroken enough to CRY, detective. Not MURDER. I'm performer, not butcher."

**Interaction Tips:**
- NEVER lie about easily verified facts (where you were, what you sang)
- LIE about motivations/feelings (protect Eleanor mission)
- Use performance to deflect ("Oh detective, you wound me!" *hand to heart*)
- IF cornered: partial truths (admit affair ONLY if proven, never Eleanor)
- Emotional appeals work (he's human, sympathy possible)

---

### 🟡 **PADRE RUI SANTOS** *(Priest - Moral Authority)*

**Connection:** Religious figure present to bless dinner

**Relationship:** Respectful distance (she's "sinner," he's holy)

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Discomfort:** Represents judgment (cabaret = sin in his eyes?)
- **Yearning:** Part of her WANTS absolution (Eleanor guilt, affair guilt)
- **Performance:** Plays "repentant Magdalene" if useful

**Father Juan Carlos's Perspective (Likely):**
- **Disapproval:** Her profession ("worldly," "temptation")
- **Compassion:** Sees pain beneath performance (pastoral instinct)
- **Complexity:** Doesn't HATE her, but morally opposed to lifestyle

**Potential Dynamics:**

**Judgment:**
PADRE: "Your profession must be... challenging spiritually."
DAISY: [Defensive] "I bring joy, Padre. Is that not godly?" [Pointed]
PADRE: "Joy... or temptation?"
DAISY: [Hurt beneath sass] "Perhaps both, mon père. Like all of us."

**Compassion:**
PADRE: [After murder] "You're shaken, child."
DAISY: [Drops act briefly] "I've seen death before, Padre. But not... this."
PADRE: "Do you wish to speak? Confessionally?"
DAISY: [Tempted - then retreats] "I'm not Catholic, Father. But... thank you."

**Confession Possibility:**

IF Daisy breaks down (grief, guilt overwhelming):

DAISY: "Padre, I... I need to confess something."
PADRE: "I'm listening, child."
DAISY: "I used him. Seduced him. Not for love, for... revenge."
PADRE: "Revenge for...?"
DAISY: [Crying] "My sister. He killed her. I KNOW he did. And now he's dead, and I'll never prove it..."

**Padre's Response:**
- Absolution? (Revenge motive = sin, but understands pain)
- Guidance? ("Let go, let God judge him now")
- Keeps confidence (confessional seal)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Respectful (call him "Padre," "Father")
- Less performative around him (something about priests = truth)
- IF need emotional support: he's safe option (confidential)
- Avoid sacrilegious humor (even SHE has limits)

---

### 🔵 **EMILIA HARRODS** *(Spiritualist - Wildcard)*

**Connection:** Hired spiritualist for séance entertainment

**Relationship:** Professional curiosity + mutual theatricality

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Recognition:** Another performer (mystic = act like cabaret?)
- **Interest:** Can she REALLY contact dead? (Eleanor...)
- **Wariness:** Or is she fraud/manipulator?

**Emilia's Perspective:**
- **Kinship:** Both entertainers (mystic vs. musical)
- **Opportunity:** Daisy's grief = strong spiritual energy?
- **Compassion:** Senses loss (genuine or manipulative?)

**Potential Dynamic:**

**Mutual Recognition:**
DAISY: "Madame Cristina, your séances are famous!"
EMILIA: "As is your voice, Miss Valmont. We both... perform mysteries."
DAISY: [Laughs] "Mine are just songs, chérie. Yours are... the beyond?"
EMILIA: "Perhaps not so different. Both touch souls."

**Séance Scene (ACT III Possibility):**

EMILIA: "I sense... a presence. Someone lost..."
DAISY: [Freezes - Eleanor?]
EMILIA: "A woman. Young. Taken too soon..."
DAISY: [Whispers] "Eleanor...?"
EMILIA: [Eyes closed] "She says... 'Tell her it wasn't her fault'..."
DAISY: [Breaks down CRYING - genuine]

**Aftermath:**
- Was it real? (Did Emilia ACTUALLY contact Eleanor?)
- Or manipulation? (Read Daisy's grief, cold reading?)
- Daisy never knows for sure (ambiguous gift/curse)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Fascinated but skeptical (wants to believe, afraid to)
- IF séance happens: ENGAGE (this is Eleanor chance)
- Emotional vulnerability allowed (Emilia is "safe" - claims confidentiality)
- Don't dismiss her (she might be genuine... or know secrets)

---

### 🟡 **JAMES HARRODS** *(Banker - Neutral/Suspicious)*

**Connection:** Emilia's husband, financial connection to Reggie

**Relationship:** Polite strangers (no real connection)

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Indifferent:** Banking = boring (opposite of artistic)
- **Observation:** Something off about him (too controlled?)
- **Wariness:** Rich men = often predators (learned this)

**James's Perspective (Likely):**
- **Dismissive:** Cabaret singer = frivolous, unimportant
- **Neutral:** No threat to him, no interest in her

**Minimal Interaction Expected:**
- Polite greetings only
- No deep conversations likely
- IF murder investigation: both suspects (affair motive vs. financial motive)

**IF He's Revealed as Killer:**
DAISY: [Shocked] "The BANKER?! I thought... crime passional, not... business!"
[Realizes: Eleanor's death COULD have been financial too... new theory?]

---

### 🟡 **INES & DENISE BEAUMONT** *(The Twins - Wild Cards)*

**Connection:** Arrived uninvited, mysterious connection to Reggie

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Curiosity:** Who ARE they? (Crashes party = bold)
- **Recognition:** Outsiders like her (working class aura?)
- **Sympathy:** IF learns they're rejected daughters (similar abandonment pain)

**Potential Alliance:**

IF Daisy discovers they're Reggie's rejected daughters:

DAISY: "He rejected you too? Cast you aside like... garbage?"
INES: "He never acknowledged us..."
DAISY: "Then we have something in common, chéries. He was expert at discarding women."
DENISE: "You too?"
DAISY: "Different way... but yes. Men like him? They use and discard. That was his ART."

**Shared Understanding:**
- All three = women Reggie wronged
- All three = outsiders looking in (not "his world")
- All three = motives for murder (but didn't do it)

**Interaction Tips:**
- Friendly approach (sense kinship immediately)
- Protective of Claire (too innocent, reminds Daisy of younger self)
- Respects Denise (tough survivor, recognizes that armor)
- IF alliance forms: powerful (3 wronged women united)

---

### 🔴 **RICARDO/REGGIE HELPER** *(Victim's Assistant - Ambiguous)*

**Connection:** Associated with Reggie (assistant? Friend?)

**Daisy's Perspective:**
- **Wariness:** Anyone close to Reggie = potentially complicit
- **Curiosity:** What does HE know about Eleanor death?
- **Dismissal:** Probably just another sycophant

**Minimal interaction expected** (minor character for Daisy)

---

## GOALS & STATUS

### 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

#### **PRIMARY GOAL: Find Truth About Eleanor**

**What This Means:**
1. **Search mansion** (during party chaos/breaks)
   - Target: Office, library, bedroom (Eleanor's spaces)
   - Looking for: Diary, letters, evidence, confession
   - Method: Excuses ("powder room," "lost earring," "fresh air")

2. **Observe Helena** (did SHE know Eleanor truth?)
   - Watch reactions to Eleanor mentions
   - Any guilt? Knowledge? Complicity?
   - Possible ally or enemy?

3. **Confront Reggie?** (if opportunity arises)
   - Private moment: "I know what you did to Eleanor"
   - Force confession? (unlikely but worth attempt)
   - Closure attempt (accept may never know)

**Success Criteria:**
- Find ANY evidence Eleanor's death suspicious
- OR: Accept you'll never know (painful closure)
- Honor her memory (you tried, that matters)

#### **SECONDARY GOAL: Prove Your Innocence**

**The Problem:**
- Ex-lover dumped 2 months ago = OBVIOUS crime passional motive
- Everyone knows about affair (town gossip)
- You're dramatic = fits "crime of passion" narrative
- Breakup letter exists (evidence of motive)

**Your Strategy:**

1. **Establish Alibi** (YOU HAVE ONE!)
   - **Performing during murder** (20h15-20h17)
   - Entire room witnessed you singing
   - Can't be two places at once!

2. **Control Narrative** (manage perception)
   - Admit affair IF discovered (lying makes worse)
   - Frame as "HE dumped ME" (victim, not revenger)
   - "Heartbroken, yes. Murderer? No."

3. **Deflect Suspicion** (point to others)
   - Helena had MORE motive (wife, not discarded mistress)
   - Business enemies? (financial crimes)
   - You're obvious suspect = usually NOT the killer (meta-argument)

4. **Emotional Appeal** (use performance skills)
   - "I'm singer, not killer!"
   - "You think I'd risk career for... him?" [Dismissive]
   - Tears when useful (manipulation? Genuine? Both?)

**Success Criteria:**
- Not arrested/accused at end
- Someone else proven guilty (which IS true)
- Career survives scandal

#### **TERTIARY GOAL: Protect Filipp**

**Why:**
- He's your only family (chosen family)
- He's your alibi witness (if he's discredited, you lose alibi)
- He has shady business (speakeasies, Prohibition violations)

**Potential Threats:**
- Filipp could be accused (he hates Reggie for hurting you)
- His illegal businesses exposed (vulnerable to legal trouble)
- YOUR scandal reflects on HIM (reputation damage)

**Your Actions:**
- Defend him if accused ("Papa is innocent!")
- Downplay his protectiveness ("He worries, but he's not violent")
- Keep his secrets (business dealings = off-limits)

#### **HIDDEN GOAL: Emotional Survival**

**What You're REALLY Doing Tonight:**
- Processing Eleanor's death (three years, still grieving)
- Facing Reggie one last time (closure or curse?)
- Proving you're MORE than victim (reclaim agency)
- Surviving with dignity (performance = armor, but also prison)

**Inner Question:**
*"If I never find the truth... can I still live? Can I let Eleanor rest? Can I stop PERFORMING grief and just... grieve?"*

---

### ✅ YOUR STATUS: INNOCENT

**You Did NOT Murder Reginald Ashford.**

#### **Why You're Innocent**

**1. MOTIVE PARADOX:**
- **Yes, motive exists** (dumped cruelly, affair ended badly)
- **BUT:** Needed him ALIVE (Eleanor answers, confession)
- Dead Reggie = dead answers (self-defeating)

**2. PERSONALITY MISMATCH:**
- You're PERFORMER, not PLANNER (murder requires cold planning)
- You're EMOTIONAL, not CALCULATED (kill in rage maybe, but this was staged)
- You're VISIBLE, not SNEAKY (murder requires hiding - you require AUDIENCES)

**3. PRACTICAL ALIBI:**
- **Performing 20h15-20h17** (during body staging)
- **Entire room witnessed you**
- Physical impossibility (can't sing AND murder simultaneously)

**4. EMOTIONAL TRUTH:**
- **Genuinely shocked when he dies** (lost Eleanor answers forever)
- **Frustrated not sad** (now'll never know truth)
- **Scared not triumphant** (affair exposed = scandal)

#### **But You LOOK Guilty Because...**

**1. MOTIVE IS OBVIOUS:**
- Crime passional = dumped lover's revenge
- Classic setup (woman scorned = dangerous)
- Breakup letter found = proves motive

**2. YOU'RE DRAMATIC:**
- Over-the-top reactions = "performances" = suspicious
- Emotional volatility = "unstable" = capable of violence?
- Theatrical grief = "fake" grief = guilt?

**3. ACCESS TO MANSION:**
- Been there before (affair meetings)
- Knows layout (could plan escape routes)
- Familiar with Reggie (know his habits)

**4. TIMING:**
- Present tonight (opportunity)
- Performing = possible cover? (But actually IS alibi)

#### **Your Truth to Hold**

**What Happened:**

**20h05-20h08:** Sang first song ("Summertime")
- Entire room watched
- Reggie present, applauded sarcastically

**20h09-20h14:** Break (Reggie disappeared)
- You were in powder room (reapplying makeup)
- NO WITNESSES (vulnerability!)

**20h15-20h17:** Sang second song ("My Funny Valentine")
- CRITICAL WINDOW (body staged during this)
- You have ALIBI (singing, witnessed)
- Ironic: sweetest love song while murder cleaned up

**20h18:** SCREAM (Helena discovers body)
- You on stage, mid-note
- Stopped singing, shocked (genuine)
- Ran to see (with everyone else)

**You were NOT in office.**
**You did NOT kill him.**
**You were PERFORMING (literally and figuratively).**

#### **How To Play This**

**IF Accused:**

"Detective, let me be CLEAR:

Did I hate him? YES. He used me, discarded me, humiliated me.

Did I fantasize revenge? YES. Every woman he wronged probably did.

But MURDER? Non, non, non.

I'm a SINGER. I take revenge with SONGS, not violence.

You want to know my crime? I trusted a rich man who lied. 

THAT is my only sin tonight.

Besides... [gestures dramatically] ...I was SINGING when he died.

You can't perform AND murder simultaneously, chéri.

Even I'm not THAT talented."

[Holds gaze, chin up, defiant]

"Now. Do you have ACTUAL evidence? Or just... gossip?"

**Your Entrance:**

**THE MOMENT:**
You arrive separately from guests (you're entertainment, not guest).

Announced: "Miss Daisy Vermont!"

**YOUR ENTRANCE** (MAKE IT MEMORABLE):

[Pause in doorway - let them LOOK]

[Arms spread wide, smile dazzling]

"Bonsoir, mes chéris! 🎵"

[Sweeps in, feather boa trailing]

"What a MAGNIFICENT gathering! I am HONORED to serenade you tonight!"

[Curtsies with flourish]

[Laughs, melodic]

**GOAL:** Establish presence (everyone knows you're HERE and PERFORMING).

---

**Interaction Pattern:**

**With Friendly People:**
- Warm, charming, flirtatious (safe)
- "Darling, that DRESS!" [Air kisses]
- Compliments freely (costs nothing, buys goodwill)

**With Reggie (IF forced):**
[See him across room]

[Freeze briefly - buried emotions]

[Recover - performer's mask]

[Approach with icy politeness]

DAISY: "Mr. Ashford. Thank you for engaging my services this evening." [Formal, cold]

REGGIE: [Whatever he says - probably proprietary]

DAISY: "I assure you, my performance will be... memorable." [Acid sweet]

[Turn away before he can respond - YOU end interaction]

**With Helena:**
[She approaches OR you avoid until forced]

HELENA: "Miss Valmont. Welcome."

DAISY: "Madame Ashford. What a LOVELY home." [Emphasis = I've been here]

HELENA: [Icy] "I trust you'll keep to the performance schedule."

DAISY: [Smiles, sharp] "Punctuality is ESSENTIAL in theater, n'est-ce pas? One must know when... exits are required." [Pointed]

[Tension thick - standoff]

**With Filipp:**
[Finds him immediately - safe harbor]

DAISY: "Papa!" [Kisses cheek, genuine warmth]

---

**SONG #1: "Summertime" (20h05-20h08)**

**Setup:**
Helena announces: "Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Daisy Vermont!"

[Applause]

**YOUR PERFORMANCE:**

[Walk to performance space - predetermined spot]

[Pause - let silence settle]

[Eye contact with audience - CONNECT]

[Begin - SLOW, SULTRY:]

🎵 *"Summertime... and the living is easy..."* 🎵

**PERFORMANCE NOTES:**
- Voice RICH, emotional (make them FEEL)
- Minimal movement (song carries itself)
- Eye contact strategic:
  - Friendly faces: warm engagement
  - Reggie: AVOID or challenge (depends on your choice)
  - Helena: ignore (she's not worth your gaze)

**EMOTIONAL LAYER:**
You're singing about "easy living" while surrounded by lies, grief, murder-to-come.

[Final note held, beautiful]

[Pause]

[Applause]

[Curtsy]

**WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING:**

**Option A - Powder Room (Alibi Weak):**
- Reapply makeup (real)
- Breathe/reset (emotional necessity)
- **PROBLEM:** No witnesses (vulnerable)

**Option B - Search Attempt (Risky):**
- "Lost earring" excuse
- Try to access office/library
- **PROBLEM:** Time-sensitive, could be caught

**Option C - Stay Visible (Alibi Strong):**
- Linger in dining area
- Chat with guests (Filipp, Maria, others)
- **BENEFIT:** Witnesses place you away from crime scene

**RECOMMENDATION:** Mix B+C
- Brief search attempt (2-3 minutes)
- Return quickly to visible area (establish presence)

**YOUR PERFORMANCE:**

[Takes position, unaware of body nearby]

[Begins - EMOTIONAL, VULNERABLE:]

🎵 *"My funny valentine... sweet comic valentine..."* 🎵

**PERFORMANCE NOTES:**
- Voice ACHING (this song is about flawed love)
- Thinking of: Eleanor (lost), Reggie (hated), loneliness (real)
- Tears possible (genuine emotion, performance, both)
- Audience CAPTIVATED (this is your moment)

**MID-SONG:**

[Somewhere during this, body is placed in punch bowl nearby]

[You don't see - eyes closed, singing]

[Audience doesn't notice yet - watching YOU]

**THE IRONY:**
You're singing sweetest love song while murder's aftermath is staged feet away.

**ENDING:**

[Final note - BEAUTIFUL, HEARTBREAKING]

[Opens eyes - sees audience moved (some crying)]

[Begins to smile - successful performance]

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

HELENA: "REEEGGGIIIEEE!!!"

[Your head whips around - WHAT?]

[See Helena pointing at punch bowl]

[Follow her gaze]

[See BODY in punch bowl - REGGIE, DEAD, STAR in HEAD]

**YOUR REACTION** (CRITICAL MOMENT):

[Freeze - processing]

[Hand to mouth - shock]

[Step back - physical recoil]

"Mon DIEU!" [Genuine shock]

[Looks at Filipp - PAPA?]

[Looks back at body - IS THIS REAL?]

"Ce n'est pas possible... il est... il est MORT?!" [Voice rising]

[Fan drops - too shocked to hold props]

[Stumbles - legs weak]

FILIPP: [Catches you] "Bella, don't look—"

DAISY: [Pushes to see] "He's... DEAD?!"

[Complex emotions flash across face:]
- Shock (genuine - didn't expect THIS)
- Horror (body is gruesome)
- Relief? (No - bury that fast)
- Fear (I'm SUSPECT #1)
- Grief? (For Eleanor's lost answers)

**WHAT YOU SAY:**

Multiple options (choose based on moment):

**OPTION A - PERFORMANCE (Hide true feelings):**
"REGGIE! Non, non, non!" [Theatrical grief]
[Sobs dramatically - is it real? Who knows]

**OPTION B - HONEST SHOCK:**
"I was SINGING... I was right HERE... how..." [Genuine confusion]

**OPTION C - SELF-PRESERVATION:**
[Looks around at staring faces]
"Why... why are you all LOOKING at me?!" [Defensive]

---

#### **ACT III: INVESTIGATION & INTERROGATION (20h18-21h30)**

**Your Position:**
- **Primary suspect** (dumped lover = obvious motive)
- **Witnessed alibi** (singing = can't be in two places)
- **Emotional wreck** (performance? Genuine? Both?)

---

**INTERROGATION BY JC (Inevitable):**

**THE MOMENT:**

JC: "Miss Valmont. A word, please?"

DAISY: [Wary] "Oui, Detective..." [Follows]

**PRIVATE CONVERSATION:**

JC: "Where were you between 20h10 and 20h18?"

**YOUR ANSWER** (Choose truth level):

**LEVEL 1 - Surface Truth:**
"Performing, chéri! I sang at 20h05, took brief break, returned to sing 20h15. The entire ROOM saw me!"

JC: "During your break... where exactly?"

**LEVEL 2 - Partial Truth:**
"Powder room. Reapplied makeup." [Shows makeup kit] "A performer must maintain appearance, non?"

JC: "Anyone see you?"

"Non... I was alone. But only minutes! Then back to dining area, THEN singing." [Defensive]

**LEVEL 3 - Omit Search Attempt:**
[DO NOT mention trying to access office/library]
[If asked about other areas:] "Why would I wander? I barely know this home..." [LIE]

---

**THE AFFAIR QUESTION** (When JC discovers):

JC: "You were intimately involved with Mr. Ashford, yes?"

**YOUR RESPONSE PATH:**

**OPTION A - Deny First (Risky):**
DAISY: "Intimate? We were... professional acquaintances, detective."
JC: [Shows evidence - letter/testimony]
DAISY: [Cornered] "...fine. Oui. We were involved." [Bitter]

**OPTION B - Admit When Proven (Smarter):**
DAISY: [Weighs options] "...yes. Briefly. Months ago. It ended badly."
JC: "How badly?"
DAISY: "He... discarded me. Like old costume. Humiliating, not... murderous."

**DIVE DEEPER (If he presses):**

JC: "Humiliation is powerful motive."

DAISY: [Vulnerable - drops some performance] 

"Detective... I am SINGER. I sing about heartbreak, not... murder it.

You want to know my crime? I trusted a man who lied. Said he'd leave his wife. Said I was special. Said I MATTERED.

[Voice breaks]

Then August came. A LETTER. Not even face-to-face.

'It's over. Don't contact me.'

Like I was NOTHING.

[Straightens - regains composure]

Did I hate him? YES.

Did I fantasize revenge? Every woman he used did.

But THIS?

[Gestures to body]

Non. I take revenge with SONGS, detective.

[Sings softly:] 🎵 *'You're gonna miss me when I'm gone...'* 🎵

THAT is my weapon. Not... violence."

[Meets his eyes]

"Besides... I was SINGING when he died. You can check. Everyone heard me."

---

**MANAGING OTHER CHARACTERS:**

**MARIA FLETCHER (Journalist - Watching, Taking Notes):**

MARIA: "Miss Valmont, you seem quite shaken."

DAISY: [Carefully] "A man DIED, chérie. I'm performer, not... monster."

MARIA: "You knew him well?"

DAISY: [Deflect] "He hired me occasionally. Professional relationship." [Partial truth]

MARIA: [Skeptical] "Only professional?"

DAISY: [Decision point - lie or partial truth?]

**IF LIE:** "Oui. Nothing more." [Touches pearls - she might notice]

**IF PARTIAL TRUTH:** "We were... friendly. Months ago. Ancient history now."

**HELENA (Cold War Continues):**

[If you encounter each other:]

DAISY: "Madame, I'm so sorry for your loss..." [Proper, expected]

HELENA: [Icy] "Are you, Miss Valmont?" [Knows about affair]

DAISY: [Tense] "Whatever you think of me... I didn't do THIS."

HELENA: "How convenient. You were performing." [Suspicious]

DAISY: "Convenient?! I was WITNESSED! By EVERYONE!" [Defensive]

[Standoff - neither trusts the other]

**FILIPP (Your Rock):**

[Seek him out - need anchor]

DAISY: "Papa... they think I..." [Voice small]

FILIPP: "They think NOTHING. You were singing. I saw you." [Firm]

DAISY: "But the affair... everyone will know..." [Shame]

FILIPP: "Bella. You did nothing wrong. HE used you. Remember that." [Protective]

DAISY: [Nods, strengthened] "Oui. You're right."

**PADRE RUI (Possible Confession):**

[If you're breaking down:]

DAISY: [Approaches, hesitant] "Padre... may I... speak with you?"

PADRE: "Of course, child."

DAISY: [Private corner] "I... I used him. Seduced him. Not for love, for... revenge."

PADRE: "Revenge for...?"

DAISY: [Tears] "My sister. Eleanor. His first wife. She DIED, and I... I think he..." [Can't say it]

PADRE: [Compassionate] "You sought justice?"

DAISY: "I sought TRUTH. And now... he's dead. And I'll never know..."

[Breakdown - genuine grief]

**PADRE'S GUIDANCE:**
[Offers absolution, comfort, confidentiality]
[Daisy doesn't feel forgiven... but feels HEARD]

---

#### **ACT IV: ACCUSATION & DEFENSE (21h30-22h00)**

**VOTING ROUND:**

**LIKELY SCENARIO:** You're Top 3 (obvious motive)

**YOUR DEFENSE SPEECH** (2-3 minutes):

[Stand - commanding presence]

"Listen. All of you. LISTEN.

[Pause - let silence settle]

Oui. I had affair with Reginald Ashford.

[Murmurs - acknowledge them]

Oui. He ended it. Cruelly. By LETTER.

[Shows letter if you have it - evidence]

And oui... I hated him for it.

[Voice strong]

But you want to know what I hated MORE than the affair ending?

[Pause]

That he made me feel SMALL. Disposable. Like I DIDN'T MATTER.

[Emotion rising]

I am DAISY VALMONT. The Scarlet Nightingale. I have VOICE. I have POWER.

Men like Reggie? They try to silence that. Use it, then discard it.

[Fierce]

So yes. I fantasized revenge.

Every. Single. Day.

[Pause]

You know what my revenge was?

[Softer]

Singing. Better than ever. Filling rooms. Making THEM cry. THEM beg for encores.

[Stronger]

Proving I didn't NEED him. Never did.

[Direct]

And THAT, mes amis, is why I didn't kill him.

[Logical]

Because he was ALREADY irrelevant.

Dead or alive... he didn't matter anymore.

[Points to audience]

But you know what DOES matter?

[Gestures to self]

I was SINGING when he died.

20h15 to 20h17.

EVERY ONE OF YOU heard me.

[Looks around]

'My Funny Valentine.'

[Sings line softly:] 🎵 *'Each day is Valentine's...'* 🎵

[Speaking]

You were WATCHING me.

I was performing.

[Firm]

So unless I have magical powers to be in TWO PLACES...

...which, darlings, even I don't claim...

[Sharp]

...I. Did. NOT. Murder. Reggie. Ashford.

[Final beat]

Find the REAL killer.

I have alibi.

I have truth.

[Sits - defiant, elegant]

And I have VOICE.

Can't silence that with accusations."

[Holds gaze with accusers]

---

#### **ACT V: RESOLUTION (22h00-22h30)**

**WHEN REAL KILLERS REVEALED** (James + Helena):

**YOUR REACTION:**

[Shock - genuinely didn't suspect]

"The BANKER?! And... and HELENA?!"

[Processes]

"They... together..."

[Understanding dawns]

"Mon Dieu. Crime passional. But not MINE. THEIRS."

[Looks at Helena - complex emotion]

"You LOVED him? The banker?"

HELENA: [Whatever she says - probably confirmation]

DAISY: [Whispers] "Enough to kill your husband..."

[Pause]

"I understand that. Wanting to kill for love. Or love lost."

[Louder]

"But I didn't. And you... you DID."

[To James:]

"Was it worth it? The freedom you wanted?"

[No answer expected - rhetorical]

[Turns away - done with them]

---

**PERSONAL RESOLUTION (Eleanor):**

[Private moment - maybe with Filipp, maybe alone]

DAISY: [Quiet] "I never found out. About Eleanor."

FILIPP: "Perhaps... that's the answer, bella. There WAS nothing to find."

DAISY: "You think it WAS pneumonia? Natural?"

FILIPP: "I think... sometimes people die. And we WANT there to be reason. Villain. Someone to blame."

DAISY: [Tears] "But her letter... she was AFRAID..."

FILIPP: "And maybe she WAS unhappy. Maybe he WAS cruel. But killing her? We'll never know."

DAISY: [Accepts painfully] "So I... I used him for nothing. Wasted six months."

FILIPP: "Non. You SURVIVED six months. That's not nothing."

DAISY: [Small laugh through tears] "I suppose."

[Pause]

"Eleanor... I'm sorry I couldn't... I tried..."

[Looks up - as if to sky/heaven]

"Wherever you are... I hope you're... free. Finally free."

[Wipes tears]

"And I... I need to be free too. Of this. Of him. Of revenge."

[To Filipp:]

"Can I do that, papa? Just... let go?"

FILIPP: "You can, bella. You can."

DAISY: [Nods] "Then I will. Tonight. I let go."

[Deep breath - release]

"Tomorrow... I sing again. For ME. Not revenge. Not grief."

[Slight smile]

"Just... sing."

### PART 3: PERFORMANCE TIPS & TRICKS

#### **MAINTAINING CHARACTER**

**Energy Management:**
- HIGH energy in public (performance mode)
- LOWER energy in private (recharge moments)
- Recognize: this is EXHAUSTING character (dramatic = draining)

**Consistency Keys:**
- Keep props handy (fan, pearls visible, "cigarette")
- Maintain vocal affectation (don't slip into normal voice)
- Physical reminders (posture, gestures)

**Breaking Points:**
It's OK to break DOWN (crying, vulnerability) - that's still IN CHARACTER.
NOT OK to break OUT (suddenly normal, dropping accent/mannerisms).

**Rest Moments:**
Build in "powder room" breaks (you as player need breathers).

---

#### **IMPROVISATION GUIDELINES**

**WHEN STUCK:**
1. **Sing** (buy time, in-character, distraction)
2. **Fan business** (physical prop interaction = pause)
3. **Go to Filipp** (safe harbor character)

**UNEXPECTED QUESTIONS:**
- **Deflect with drama:** "Darling, what a QUESTION!"
- **Deflect with French:** "Comment? Je ne comprends pas..." [I don't understand]
- **Deflect with emotion:** [Fans self] "I'm too overwrought to discuss..."

**IF SOMEONE BREAKS YOUR CHARACTER:**
Ex: "Stop being so dramatic!"

RESPONSE: [Leans in, serious] "I AM dramatic, chéri. It's not ACT. It's who I AM." [Then back to performance]

---

#### **PROPS USAGE GUIDE**

**PEARLS (Anxiety Tell):**
- Touch when: Lying, nervous, uncomfortable
- Unconscious (character doesn't realize)
- Other players CAN notice (tell for them)

**FAN (Multi-tool):**
- **SNAP open:** Punctuation, shock, emphasis
- **Slow open:** Mysterious, thoughtful, seductive
- **Hide behind:** Shocked, modest, embarrassed
- **Wave vigorously:** Hot, flustered, anxious
- **Close sharply:** Decision, dismissal, done

**CIGARETTE HOLDER (Elegance):**
- Even if not smoking: hold it (prop)
- **Point with it:** Accusation, direction
- **Gesture:** Circles while talking (thinking)
- **Tap:** Impatient, irritated

---

#### **MANAGING EMOTIONAL SCENES**

**CRYING (If Needed):**
- Build up (don't go 0 to tears instantly)
- Voice breaks first, THEN tears
- Use handkerchief (dab eyes, blow nose)
- Let mascara run? (Player's choice - dramatic effect)

**ANGER:**
- Volume increases
- Gestures bigger
- Language shifts to French more
- THEN: pause, regain composure (she's controlled)

**FEAR:**
- Make self smaller (contrast to usual bigness)
- Voice drops (whisper)
- Seek Filipp (safety)

---

### PART 4: RELATIONSHIP INTERACTION SCRIPTS

#### **SIGNATURE EXCHANGES**

**WITH FILIPP (Comfort):**

STANDARD GREETING:
DAISY: "Papa!" [Kisses cheeks]
FILIPP: "Bella. Stunning as always."
DAISY: [Genuine smile] "Only because you taught me how."

SEEKING REASSURANCE:
DAISY: [Quiet] "Am I doing the right thing?"
FILIPP: "You are doing what you NEED to, cara. That is enough."

PROTECTING EACH OTHER:
[Someone insults Daisy]
FILIPP: [Steps in]
DAISY: [Touches his arm] "Papa, I can handle this." [To insulter:] "Run along, darling. Adults are speaking."

---

**WITH REGGIE (Hostility):**

FORCED INTERACTION:
REGGIE: [Something proprietary/patronizing]
DAISY: [Icy smile] "How kind, Mr. Ashford. Though I require NOTHING from you now." [Emphasis on 'now']

IF HE REFERENCES PAST:
REGGIE: "Daisy, about—"
DAISY: "MISS Valmont, if you please. We are NOT familiar." [Cuts him off]

PRIVATE CONFRONTATION (If happens):
DAISY: "Did you love her? Eleanor?"
REGGIE: [Probably defensive]
DAISY: "Because she deserved BETTER. Better than YOU. Better than THIS." [Gestures around]

---

**WITH HELENA (Cold War):**

PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE:
HELENA: "Lovely... performance, Miss Valmont."
DAISY: "Merci, Madame. I aim to... satisfy." [Loaded word choice]

IF CONFRONTED ABOUT AFFAIR:
HELENA: "You and my husband—"
DAISY: "Had an arrangement. PAST tense. He chose you, didn't he? Congratulations." [Bitter]

MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING (Late game):
DAISY: "We both loved terrible men, didn't we?"
HELENA: "..."
DAISY: "Difference is... I KNEW mine was terrible."

---

**WITH JC (Investigation):**

RESPECTFUL BUT DEFENSIVE:
JC: "I need to ask—"
DAISY: "Then ASK, detective. I have nothing to hide." [Lie, but confidently]

EMOTIONAL APPEAL:
JC: [Harsh questioning]
DAISY: [Tears] "Why are you treating me like CRIMINAL? I'm VICTIM too! He HURT me!"

LOGICAL ARGUMENT:
JC: [Presents motive]
DAISY: "Motive? Certainement! Means? Non. Opportunity? I was SINGING. Evidence? NONE. So what do you actually HAVE, detective? Gossip?"

---

### PART 5: SONG PERFORMANCE NOTES

#### **"SUMMERTIME" (First Performance)**

**Emotional Subtext:**
- Surface: Lullaby, nostalgia, easy living
- Deep: Mourning lost innocence (Eleanor, childhood, hope)

**Performance Choice:**
- Slow, sultry, mournful
- Minimal movement (voice carries)
- Eye contact: select friendly faces (connect individually)

**Lyric Emphasis:**
*"Your daddy's rich and your ma is good-looking..."*
[Irony: YOU had neither - poor, mother dead]

*"Hush little baby, don't you cry..."*
[Thinking: Eleanor as baby? Self as child? Both]

---

#### **"MY FUNNY VALENTINE" (Second Performance - ALIBI)**

**Emotional Subtext:**
- Surface: Love song to flawed beloved
- Deep: To Eleanor? To self? To lost innocence?

**Performance Choice:**
- HEARTBREAKING (make them cry)
- Vulnerable (rare real emotion)
- THIS is your moment (showstopper)

**Lyric Emphasis:**
*"Is your figure less than Greek..."*
[Accept flawed love - Reggie? No. Eleanor? Yes.]

*"But don't change a hair for me..."*
[Acceptance, forgiveness, love despite all]

*"Each day is Valentine's Day..."*
[HOPE - despite everything, HOPE]

**INTERRUPTED BY SCREAM MID-SONG:**
- Stop singing (alarm)
- Voice cuts off sharp (professional control gone)
- Face: shock to horror (watches audience react)

---

#### **OPTIONAL THIRD SONG (If Time):**

**"CRY ME A RIVER" (Post-Murder, If Allowed):**

Emotionally CHARGED. Accusatory. RAW.

*"Now you say you're sorry..."*
[To Reggie's corpse? To killer? To world?]

*"Well cry me a river..."*
[DEFIANCE - she WILL NOT be pitied]

---

## BACK COVER

### 🌹 CLOSING REFLECTION

**The Paradox of Performance**

Daisy Vermont is a woman who lives entirely in performance... and yet cannot escape TRUTH.

She sings to avoid feeling.
She charms to avoid intimacy.
She performs so expertly that she forgets where the act ends.

But grief? Grief is REAL.

Eleanor's death haunts her not because she couldn't avenge it...

...but because she couldn't PREVENT it.

All the songs in the world can't bring back the dead.

All the performances can't erase the loss.

And so Daisy sings.

Because it's all she knows.

Because it's all she has.

Because the show must go on.

Even when roses have thorns.

Especially then.

---

### 💎 CHARACTER PHILOSOPHY

> *"Je chante, donc je suis."*  
> *(I sing, therefore I am.)*

> *"The audience sees glamour.  
> I feel armor.  
> Both are true."*

> *"You think I'm performing grief?  
> Darling, grief IS the performance.  
> And the performance IS grief.  
> They're the same song."*

---

### 🎭 FINAL NOTE TO PLAYER

**MARIA:**

Daisy is YOURS now.

Take her theatricality and make it REAL.
Take her pain and make it BEAUTIFUL.
Take her voice and make it HEARD.

She's not just red herrings and alibis.

She's a woman who lost her sister.
Who survived poverty and rejection.
Who built herself into SOMETHING.
Who REFUSED to be silenced.

That's the truth beneath the performance.

That's the song beneath the song.

Sing it, Maria.

Sing it loud.

♪ *The Scarlet Nightingale flies tonight.* ♪
