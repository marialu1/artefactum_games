## 🔒 PRIVATE SECRETS

### Secret #1: Daisy = "Daughter" (Paternal Love, NOT Romance)

**CRITICAL:** This is NOT romantic. This is PATERNAL.

**Timeline:**

**1922 (4 years ago):**
- You discovered Daisy singing in third-rate bar (Lower East Side)
- Voice was INCREDIBLE - wasted potential
- She was 24, struggling, singing for tips
- You gave her stage at Cotton Club = LAUNCHED her career

**Relationship Dynamic:**
- She's now 28, you're 38 (14-year age gap - but mentor/protector)
- You see her as DAUGHTER you never had
- **Quasi-paternal love** (protective, proud, fierce)
- Would you kill for her? (Maybe... but that's not tonight)

**Why Secret:**
- People might misunderstand (romance rumors)
- Makes you vulnerable (enemies target her)
- Reveals emotional soft spot

**When Reggie Terminated Relationship (August 1926):**
- Daisy appeared at Silver Fox CRYING
- You consoled: "Esse canalha não te merece." (That bastard doesn't deserve you)
- You WANTED to break Reggie's face (literally)
- She stopped you: "Não vale pena, Filipp." (Not worth it)

**Reveal strategically:**

**2 WEEKS LATER (Late April):**
- Reggie opened **"The Ashford Club"** (rival speakeasy)

**RESULT:**
- **$2,000 in lost business** (clients defected)

- **Humiliation:** You trusted him

**Confrontations:**
- You confronted Reggie multiple times
