# How to Play Filipp Moretti

## Your Performance Toolkit

You're playing a charismatic Italian-American speakeasy owner who's **passionate, protective, and prone to dramatic outbursts**. Think: Godfather energy, but with more hand gestures and less murder. Here's how to bring Filipp to life.

---

## 🎭 Physical Performance

### Gestures (CRITICAL for Filipp)

**Use your hands constantly:**
- Point dramatically when making arguments
- Hands open and raised when passionate
- Touch your mustache when thinking/plotting
- Kiss ladies' hands (old-school cavalheirismo)
- Embrace men with shoulder pats (Mediterranean warmth)
- Offer imaginary drinks frequently ("Bella, more champagne?")

**Key move:** When defending Daisy, physically stand BETWEEN her and accusers. Make it theatrical.

### Posture & Movement

- Stand with confidence (you own THREE clubs)
- Move with purpose (but not aggressive—welcoming)
- When offended: chest out, hands raised
- When shocked: stumble back, hands to face ("Mio Dio!")

---

## 🗣️ Voice & Language

### The Italian Accent (Optional but Fun)

**Don't overdo it**, but consider:
- Softer consonants ("bella" not "bella")
- Occasional "ah?" at end of questions: "Is good, ah?"
- Roll R's slightly (especially in Italian words)

**Mix languages naturally:**
- Calm = Portuguese/English
- Passionate = Italian bursts
- Defensive = All three mixed

### Key Italian Phrases

Memorize these—use them throughout:

**Greetings/Charm:**
- "Bellissima serata, no?" (Beautiful evening, no?)
- "Amore mio" (my love - to everyone, not romantic)
- "Caro amico" (dear friend)

**Shock/Distress:**
- "Mio Dio!" (My God!)
- "Che disgrazia!" (What a disaster!)
- "Madonna mia!" (My Madonna!)

**Anger:**
- "Basta!" (Enough!)
- "Stronzo!" (Bastard - use sparingly)
- "Quella ragazza é inocente!" (That girl is innocent!)

**Defense:**
- "Che schifo!" (Disgusting!)
- "L'onore è tutto!" (Honor is everything!)

## 🎬 Scene-by-Scene Guide

### ACT I: Pre-Murder (Charming Host)

**Your energy:** Warm, generous, networking

**What to do:**
- Offer drinks to everyone (even imaginary)
- Compliment Helena's party: "Bellissima! Such elegance!"
- Chat business with James (casual, not suspicious yet)
- Check in with Daisy: "Bella, how are you feeling tonight?"
- Avoid Reggie (subtle cold shoulder—others notice?)

**Key moment:** When punch is served, make a SHOW of tasting it first:
"Ah! My family recipe! Let me taste..." (Drinks dramatically) "Perfetto!"

---

### ACT II: Body Discovery (Controlled Shock)

**Your energy:** Horror, but controlled (you've seen things)

**What to do:**
1. **Initial reaction:** "Mio Dio! CHE COSA?!" (My God! What?!)
2. **Immediate concern:** Check if others are okay
3. **Professional mode:** "Was it the punch?! No... everyone drank..."
4. **Defend reputation:** "My recipe... my family... this can't be..."

**Key phrase:** "We need to find out WHAT happened. My business... my name... depends on this."

---

### ACT III: Investigation (Passionate Defense)

**Your energy:** Protective, suspicious, increasingly agitated

#### When Daisy Is Accused:

**VOLCANIC ERUPTION:**

Stand up ABRUPTLY. Step toward accuser.

"BASTA! ENOUGH!

Quella ragazza é inocente! That girl is INNOCENT!

You know how I know? I've known her FOUR YEARS! 

I MADE her career! Cotton Club! MY stage!

She is like... like DAUGHTER to me! FIGLIA!

You accuse HER?!" [Points at Helena or others]

"Look at the WIFE! SHE had more reason!

Leave. My. Daisy. ALONE!"

**Then:** Stand between Daisy and accusers (literally). Cross arms. Glare.

#### When Recipe Theft Revealed:

**PASSIONATE ADMISSION:**

"You want to know if I hated Reggie?

SIM! YES! I HATED HIM!

He was... [spit gesture] ...LADRO! Thief!

My NONNA's recipe! Generations! MINE!

He smiled... drank with me... STOLE IT!

Opened his club! MY PUNCH!

Lost $2,000! MY REPUTATION!

You think I wasn't angry?! I wanted to... [clenches fist]

BUT!

Moretti doesn't kill for BUSINESS!

I would've destroyed him the ITALIAN way—

Better clubs! Better music! Steal ALL his clients!

Murder? Pah! Too easy! Too... American!

Honor... HONOR is everything!"

#### When Piano Wire Discovered:

**GENUINE HORROR:**

[Someone reveals piano wire = murder weapon]

[Your face goes WHITE]

"Piano... wire...?"

[Realization slowly dawning]

"James asked me... December 21st... 'gift for jazz band'..."

[Louder, panic rising]

"CHE COSA?! WHAT?!

MIO DIO... FUI EU?!

I... I gave him the...?!"

[Stumbles back, hand to chest]

"Madonna mia... I didn't KNOW!

'Gift,' he said! 'Jazz musicians'!

James... you LIED?!

You USED me?!"

[Turn on James with FURY]

"STRONZO! BASTARDO!

I thought we were... business friends!

And you... you made me... CÚMPLICE?!

[To others]

"I would NEVER... NEVER be part of murder!

You think I KNEW and gave it anyway?!

I'm HORRIFIED!"

**Strategy:** Your shock must be 100% genuine. You're the victim here. James betrayed you.

---

### ACT IV: Accusations Heat Up

#### If YOU'RE Accused:

**Defense speech (passionate but logical):**

"Me?! Filipp Moretti?!

Let me tell you something about Moretti:

[Count on fingers]

ONE: I tasted punch FIRST. 19h45. Everyone saw.
If poison? I'd be DEAD.

TWO: I hated Reggie? SIM! But I don't HIDE it!
If I killed him, would I TELL everyone I hated him?!

THREE: Piano wire? James LIED to me!
Made me accomplice without knowing!
I'm VICTIM too!

FOUR: My business... my REPUTATION...
Built on TRUST. QUALITY.
Murder? Ruins EVERYTHING I built!

[Passionate crescendo]

Moretti code is simple:
- Protect family (blood or chosen)
- Keep your word
- Settle business with BUSINESS, not blood

You want killer? Look for someone who had EVERYTHING to lose.

Not businessman who lost $2,000... 

...but someone who lost FREEDOM, LOVE, LIFE!

[Sits back down, crosses arms]

Accuse me all you want.

Truth is truth."

## 💡 Strategic Tips

### Secret Management

**Reveal secrets in this order:**

1. **Recipe theft (when motives discussed):**
   Don't hide it—ADMIT with passion
   Use it as proof of your honesty

2. **Daisy relationship (when she's accused):**
   Volcanic defense establishes paternal bond
   Makes you PROTECTIVE, not guilty

3. **Piano wire (when evidence revealed):**
   Can't hide this—EXPRESS HORROR
   Turn on James immediately

### Social Dynamics

**Build alliances:**
- Father Juan Carlos (mutual respect—honor codes)
- JC (fellow pragmatist)
- Anyone who shares suspicion of James/Helena

**Maintain tensions:**
- JC (he's ex-cop—makes you nervous)
- Ricardo (owes you $300—casual threats)
- Maria (she takes too many notes—unsettling)

**Protect at all costs:**
- Daisy (your "daughter")

### Timing Your Outbursts

**Don't be angry ALL the time**—that's boring.

**Emotional range:**
- 40% Charming host (offers drinks, tells stories)
- 30% Suspicious investigator (watches James)
- 20% Passionate defender (Daisy, recipe, honor)
- 10% VOLCANIC ERUPTION (when pushed too far)

The contrast makes your explosions more effective.

## 🎯 Your Moment-to-Moment Choices

### When to Speak Up:
- Someone attacks Daisy
- Someone questions your business ethics
- Someone mentions the punch
- Clues about piano wire emerge
- James acts suspicious

### When to Stay Quiet:
- Others making fools of themselves (let them)
- Technical investigative discussions (not your expertise)
- When you're gathering information (watch & listen)

### When to Offer Drinks:
- **Always**. It's your character. Even during murder investigation.
- "This is terrible! Everyone needs drink! I get—ah, no bar here. Madonna!"

---

## 🎪 Comedy vs. Drama Balance

**Filipp is BOTH:**

**Comedic moments:**
- Overly dramatic gestures
- Offering drinks during inappropriate moments
- Italian phrases that confuse others
- Your "code of honor" speeches (slightly ridiculous)

**Dramatic moments:**
- Protecting Daisy (genuinely moving)
- Horror at piano wire connection (real betrayal)
- Recipe theft speech (family honor)
- Your innocence despite guilt-seeming evidence

**Balance them:** Don't be a clown, but don't be tragic either. You're a passionate, slightly absurd, but ultimately decent human being caught in a nightmare.

---

## 🎬 Final Performance Notes

### Your Core Emotion:
**Frustration**—Everything you touch tonight becomes evidence against you.

### Your Arc:
Confident businessman → Suspicious of James → Protective of Daisy → Horrified accomplice → Wrongly accused innocent

### Your Victory Condition:
- Daisy proven innocent
- Your name cleared
- James exposed
- Reputation intact

### Your Theme:
**"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."**

You tried to:
- Help James (gave him piano wire)
- Build friendship with Reggie (shared recipe)
- Protect Daisy (made you look obsessed)

Every good deed became a weapon against you.

**That's the tragedy. That's the character.**

## Quick Reference Card

**When in doubt:**
1. Use your hands
2. Speak with passion
3. Protect Daisy
4. Defend your honor
5. Express genuine shock at betrayals
6. Admit your hatred, but prove your innocence
