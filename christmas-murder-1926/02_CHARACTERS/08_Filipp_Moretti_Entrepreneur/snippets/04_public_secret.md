# Public Secret
## What You Can Share Freely

You are here because you supplied the punch for tonight's party.

## Your Business (Open Secret)

**You own 3 speakeasies in Manhattan:**
- **"Silver Fox Lounge"** (flagship - Harlem, jazz, quality)
- **"Moretti's Jazz Club"** (Greenwich Village)
- **"The Italian Garden"** (Little Italy)

Everyone knows this. During Prohibition, everyone drinks—high society especially. Your speakeasies are where Astors, Vanderbilts, and Ashfords go for quality entertainment.

**Your reputation:** Premium alcohol, never watered down, treat performers well, run a clean operation.

## What You Can Say Openly

✓ "I own the Silver Fox Lounge and two other establishments"  
✓ "The punch is my family recipe—generations old"  
✓ "I arrived early and tested it myself at 19h45"  
✓ "Everyone at this party has been to my clubs"  
✓ "During Prohibition, we all bend the rules a little, no?"

**This establishes you as:** Successful, connected, legitimate businessman (as legitimate as speakeasy owners can be), but not threatening.

## Strategic Use

**When suspicion falls on the punch:**
- Point out YOU drank it first
- Point out EVERYONE drank before the murder
- Defend your family recipe with passion: "Mio ponche?! MINHA receita FAMÍLIA?!"

**When people question your "illegal" business:**
- Laugh it off: "Bella, everyone drinks. I just serve better quality than most."
- Redirect: "We're here for Helena's hospitality, not to debate Prohibition, no?"

This public information makes you look successful and confident—not like someone hiding dark secrets.

*(Spoiler: You ARE hiding dark secrets. Three of them. But that's for later.)*
