# Your Goals & Status

## What You're Trying to Accomplish Tonight

You came here for business and networking. Now there's a body in the punch bowl. Your priorities have shifted dramatically.

---

## 🎯 Goal #1: Prove the Punch Is Safe

**Why this matters:**
- Your REPUTATION is built on quality
- If people think your punch killed Reggie, your business is RUINED
- $85 contract tonight, but thousands in future business at stake

**How to achieve it:**
- Point out YOU drank it first (19h45, before everyone)
- Point out EVERYONE drank before the murder (20h18)
- Defend your family recipe with PASSION
- Find the REAL cause of death (not the punch)

**Key phrases:**
- "Mio ponche?! MINHA receita FAMÍLIA?!"
- "I tasted it FIRST! You all saw!"
- "If poison, we'd ALL be dead!"

## 🎯 Goal #2: Protect Daisy from Accusations

**Why this matters:**
- She's like a DAUGHTER to you
- You launched her career (Cotton Club, 4 years ago)
- Her affair with Reggie = obvious motive (crime passional)
- People WILL suspect her

**How to achieve it:**
- Defend her FIERCELY when accused
- Stand between her and accusers (literally)
- Redirect suspicion to others (Helena has STRONGER motive)
- Use your paternal relationship as proof of innocence

**Key phrases:**
- "BASTA! Quella ragazza é inocente!" (ENOUGH! That girl is innocent!)
- "I've known her FOUR years! She doesn't kill!"
- "You want to accuse someone? Look at the WIFE!"

**Warning:** Don't be TOO protective—it looks suspicious. Balance passion with logic.

## 🎯 Goal #3: Avoid Connection to Piano Wire

**Why this matters:**
- YOU supplied the piano wire to James (December 21st)
- He said it was a "gift for a jazz band"
- If it's revealed as the murder weapon, you look like an ACCOMPLICE
- This could destroy you

**How to achieve it:**
- Hope it doesn't come out at all (unlikely)
- If discovered: EXPRESS GENUINE SHOCK
- Turn on James immediately: "He LIED to me!"
- Play the victim: "I thought we were friends..."

**Your genuine reaction when you find out:**
- *"MIO DIO... FUI EU?!"* (My God... it was ME?!)
- *"James... you USED me... STRONZO!"* (bastard)
- Horror, panic, then rage at betrayal

---

## 🎯 Goal #4 (Hidden): Investigate James's Business Betrayal

**Why this matters:**
- You invested $8,000 in James's ventures (silent partner, 2 clubs)
- Last 2 months: numbers don't add up
- Suspect he's either embezzling OR preparing to seize your clubs
- Tonight might be your chance to confront him

**How to pursue it:**
- Watch James closely during the chaos
- If opportunity arises, pull him aside: "Precisamos conversar. Negócios."
- Use the murder investigation as cover for probing his activities

**But:** This becomes SECONDARY once you discover the piano wire connection. Then it's personal betrayal on TWO fronts.

## Your Status: INNOCENT (But Look Guilty)

### ✅ The Truth

**You did NOT kill Reginald Ashford.**

You're innocent of murder. Completely.

### ❌ The Problem

**You look EXTREMELY guilty:**

**Motive:** Reggie stole your family recipe → Lost $2,000 + reputation → HATRED  
**Means:** You supplied the murder weapon (piano wire) → Unwitting accomplice  
**Opportunity:** You were at the party, had access to everything  
**Temperament:** Hot-blooded Italian with protective streak → "Capable of violence"

### 🎭 The Strategy

**Embrace the contradictions:**

1. **Admit the hatred OPENLY**  
   "Sim, I HATED him! He stole from my FAMILY!"

2. **But invoke your code of honor**  
   "Moretti doesn't kill for BUSINESS! Too... American!"

3. **Passionate honesty = your defense**  
   You don't HIDE your rage—that makes you trustworthy (paradoxically)

4. **When piano wire revealed: GENUINE shock**  
   Your horror at being used must be 100% real—because it IS

---

## The Tragedy

**What you wanted tonight:** Professional success, networking, protect Daisy

**What you got:** 
- A dead client
- Your punch bowl as a crime scene  
- Your weapon as the murder tool
- Your protégée as prime suspect
- Your business partner as the actual killer

**You're the perfect red herring:** All the pieces point to you, but none of them are YOUR fault.

That's the cruel irony—and your emotional core for the night.

## Remember

You're not playing a murderer trying to hide guilt.  
You're playing an INNOCENT man drowning in circumstantial evidence.

The more passionately you defend yourself, the more suspicious you look.  
The more you try to help, the deeper you sink.

**That's the fun.**
