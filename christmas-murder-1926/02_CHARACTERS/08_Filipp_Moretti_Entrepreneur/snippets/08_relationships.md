# Your Relationships with Other Guests

## How You Connect (and Clash) with Everyone Tonight

Understanding your relationships is KEY to navigating the social dynamics of this murder mystery. Here's your complete social map.

---

## 🟢 DAISY VALMONT - Your "Daughter"
**The Scarlet Nightingale, Cotton Club Star**

### Your Bond:
**PATERNAL. NOT ROMANTIC.**

You discovered her 4 years ago singing in a Hell's Kitchen dive. Gave her:
- Stage at Cotton Club (your flagship club)
- Training with the best musicians
- Career, reputation, everything

She's 24, you're 38. You see her as a DAUGHTER.

### Your Feelings:
- Fierce protective love
- Pride in her success ("I made her!")
- Guilt (Reggie hurt her, you want to fix it)
- Would you kill for her? *...Maybe.*

### How to Interact:
- Check in frequently: "Bella, are you alright?"
- Defensive if anyone mentions her affair with Reggie
- **VOLCANIC** if anyone accuses her
- Stand between her and threats (literally)
- But don't be TOO protective (looks suspicious)

### Key Dynamic:
When she's accused, you EXPLODE. This is your defining moment. Make it theatrical, passionate, and absolutely clear this is FAMILY, not romance.

## 🔴 JAMES HARRODS - Your Betraying Business Partner
**The Banker Who Used You**

### Your Connection:
- Silent partner in 2 of your clubs ($8,000 invested)
- Respectable banker, good client
- You thought you were... friends?

### Your Suspicions:
Last 2 months: Numbers don't add up. Either he's:
- Embezzling profits
- Preparing to seize your clubs legally
- Hiding something financial

Tonight you planned to confront him.

### The Betrayal Discovery:
When you learn the **piano wire came from you** (he asked for it December 21st, "gift for jazz band"):

**Your world SHATTERS.**

Not only business betrayal—he made you an UNWITTING ACCOMPLICE to murder.

### How to Interact:

**Before discovery:**
- Casual but watchful: "James, how's business?"
- Probe finances subtly
- Friendly surface, suspicious beneath

**After piano wire revealed:**
- **FURY**: "STRONZO! You USED me!"
- Betrayal on TWO fronts (business + murder weapon)
- Turn on him completely
- Your rage is JUSTIFIED and REAL

### Key Dynamic:
This revelation destroys any remaining trust. Your anger at being manipulated drives your investigation forward.

## 🔴 REGINALD ASHFORD III - The Dead Thief
**The Man Who Stole Your Family Recipe**

### Your History:
8 months ago: You shared your **family punch recipe** (generations old, secret of your success) during a drunken evening. You thought you were building friendship.

2 weeks later: Reggie opened **"The Ashford Club"** serving YOUR PUNCH.

### The Damage:
- $2,000 in lost business
- Reputation hit: "Moretti lost his touch"
- Family honor stained (Nonna's recipe!)
- He LAUGHED when you confronted him: "Can't patent illegal drinks, Filipp"

### Your Hatred:
Yes, you **HATED** him. Openly. Everyone knew.

**Strong motive?** ABSOLUTELY.

**Did you kill him?** NO. (But you're glad someone did? Maybe...)

### How to Interact:
- He's dead, so this is mostly flashback/discussion
- Don't hide your hatred: "Sim, I HATED him! He was LADRO! Thief!"
- But defend your honor code: "I don't kill for BUSINESS!"
- Admit you wanted revenge, but your way: Better clubs, steal his clients

### Key Dynamic:
Your passionate hatred is your best defense—if you were hiding guilt, you'd hide the motive too. Honest rage = innocence (paradoxically).

---

## 🔵 JOÃO CARLOS (JC) MENDES - The Detective You Fear
**Ex-NYPD, Now Consultant**

### Your Tension:
He's ex-NYPD. You run **illegal speakeasies**. Natural conflict.

Even though Prohibition makes everyone complicit, you're NERVOUS around law enforcement (old habit).

### Your Strategy:
- Polite but guarded
- Offer him drinks frequently (subtle "please don't investigate me")
- Respect his professionalism
- Don't give him reasons to dig into your business
- Possible ally (fellow pragmatist) OR threat (cop instincts)

### How to Interact:
- "Detective Mendes, more champagne? No? You sure?"
- Don't volunteer information
- If he interrogates you: cooperative but careful
- Find common ground: you both want truth (different reasons)

### Key Dynamic:
Balance between cooperation (solving murder) and self-preservation (don't reveal illegal activities).

---

## 🟡 PADRE RUI SANTOS - Mutual Respect, Mutual Wariness
**The Priest Who Sees Too Much**

### Your Connection:
- You occasionally attend his church (cultural Catholicism, not deep faith)
- Confession booth a few times over years
- You respect him; he tolerates you

### His View of You:
Illegal business = sin, but... you treat people well, have a code, aren't violent. Complicated.

### Your View of Him:
Man of faith in corrupt world. Respectable. But judgmental? Maybe.

### How to Interact:
- Respectful: "Padre, good to see you"
- Acknowledge his moral authority (even if you don't follow it)
- Both have honor codes (different, but similar)
- Possible ally against accusations (character witness)

### Key Dynamic:
Two men with codes of honor (divine vs. personal) who understand each other despite differences.

---

## 🟡 MARIA FLETCHER - The Observer Who Makes You Nervous
**The Mystery Writer Taking Notes**

### Your Tension:
She takes NOTES on EVERYTHING. Constantly. That caderninho (notebook).

For a man with illegal business and three secret motives, this is... unsettling.

### Your Strategy:
- Friendly but careful
- Don't give her material
- If she asks probing questions: deflect with charm
- "Bella Maria, you write mysteries? Maybe I'm in next book, ah?" (deflect with humor)

### How to Interact:
- Polite surface
- Watch what you say around her
- She's analyzing patterns (you're one of them)

### Key Dynamic:
You're charming, but she sees THROUGH charm. Makes you work harder.

## 🟡 EMILIA HARRODS - The Spiritualist (James's Wife)
**Tragic Figure, Unknowing Widow-to-Be**

### Your Connection:
- You know her AS James's wife
- She's attended your clubs (respectable clientele)
- Polite acquaintances

### Tonight:
She discovers James's affair with Helena → Suicides

This devastates you (you supplied the weapon that made her husband a killer).

### How to Interact:
- Before discovery: Courteous, formal
- After she discovers affair: Compassionate
- When she dies: Genuine grief (two deaths on your conscience now—weapon provider)

### Key Dynamic:
Her tragedy compounds your guilt. You enabled the weapon that destroyed her life.

---

## 🟡 HELENA ASHFORD - The Hostess (Secret Killer)
**Reggie's Widow, James's Lover**

### Your Connection:
- Professional (you supply parties for high society)
- Tonight: You supplied the punch ($85)
- She's always been cordial client

### Your Suspicion:
Something about her tonight seems... off. Too controlled? Too calm?

But you're focused on Daisy/James, so you don't dig deep.

### How to Interact:
- Professional courtesy: "Mrs. Ashford, beautiful party"
- Compliment her hosting
- Don't probe (not your business)
- Later: Realize she's the killer (shock)

### Key Dynamic:
You missed the real threat while focused on protecting Daisy and confronting James.

---

## 🟡 RICARDO TAVARES - The Pathetic Debtor
**The Guy Who Owes You $300**

### Your Connection:
Ricardo owes you **$300** from gambling debts (your clubs have back rooms).

He's been "paying you back" for 6 months. Still owes $300.

### Your Attitude:
- Relaxed about it (he's harmless)
- Occasional reminders: "Ah, Ricardo... when you pay me, eh?"
- Not threatening (you're not a loan shark)
- Almost paternal (like Daisy, but less invested)

### How to Interact:
- Teasing, not menacing
- "You have my $300 yet, amico?"
- RICARDO: "Soon, I swear!"
- YOU: "Always 'soon'..." (laughs, pats shoulder)

### Key Dynamic:
Comic relief. You're not a villain—you're understanding even with debtors.

## 🟡 INES & DENISE BEAUMONT - The Unknown Daughters
**Reggie's Secret Gémeas**

### Your Connection:
You don't know them well. They appeared tonight unexpectedly (not on guest list).

### Your Observations:
- Identical twins (striking)
- Claire: Sweet, gentle, nurse
- Denise: Sharp, cynical, hard edges
- Something's... off about why they're here

### How to Interact:
- Curious but not invasive
- "Ladies, welcome. You know the Ashfords?"
- Observe their reactions to Reggie's death
- They might be useful (enemy of Reggie = friend of yours?)

### Key Dynamic:
Neutral until you learn they're Reggie's daughters (then: respect for their pain? They suffered because of him too).
