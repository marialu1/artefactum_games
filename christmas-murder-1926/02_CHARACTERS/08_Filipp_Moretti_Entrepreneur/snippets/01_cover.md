## "The Silver Fox"

**Speakeasy Entrepreneur**  
**Age 38**

*You built your empire from nothing—three speakeasies, a reputation for quality, and a code of honor that kept you alive in this business.*

*But tonight, someone used that code against you.*

*The piano wire you supplied "for a jazz band gift"? That was the murder weapon.*

*The punch recipe you shared "between friends"? Stolen by the victim eight months ago, costing you $2,000 and your reputation.*

*And Daisy—the girl you launched to stardom four years ago, the closest thing to a daughter you'll ever have—she's an obvious suspect because of her affair with him.*

*Now you're trapped at a Christmas party with a dead man, a room full of suspects, and the horrible realization that you accidentally armed a killer.*

*Your code says "never kill for business."*

*Can you prove you followed it?*

**🎭 YOUR GREATEST PERFORMANCE AWAITS**

*Defend your honor. Protect your "daughter." Survive the night.*
