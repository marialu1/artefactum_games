## L'onore è tutto.
*Honor is everything.*

---

You built an empire from nothing—three clubs, a reputation for quality, and a code you never break: protect your family, keep your word, settle debts with business, not blood.

Tonight, that code is being tested.

Every good intention you had—helping a friend, sharing a family secret, protecting someone you love—has become evidence against you.

The punch bowl? Yours.  
The murder weapon? You provided it.  
The motive? Everyone knows you hated him.

You're innocent. But you look guilty.

And the irony burns like good whiskey going down wrong.

**The road to hell is paved with good intentions.**

Tonight, you'll walk that road with your head held high, your hands gesturing wildly, and your heart on your sleeve.

Because Filipp Moretti doesn't hide what he feels.

That passionate honesty is your greatest weapon—or your final undoing.

### Remember, amico:

🍸 You're a businessman, not a killer  
🎭 You're protective, not possessive  
💔 You're betrayed, not broken  
🔥 You're passionate, not guilty  

**And when they come for you with accusations?**

Stand tall. Speak loud. Use your hands.

*Let them see the fire in your eyes and know it's the fire of an innocent man.*

## "Se eu tivesse matado, ninguém suspeitaria."
*If I had killed him, no one would suspect me.*

### But you didn't.

### And that's the tragedy.

**Avanti, amico. Break a leg.** 🍸

*The Silver Fox never backs down.*
