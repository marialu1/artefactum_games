# GOALS & STATUS - DUAL ROLE

## PHASE 1: REGGIE'S GOALS (19h45-20h09)

### Primary Goal

**DOMINATE THE ROOM**

Make your presence felt. Establish hierarchy. Remind everyone why you're in charge.

---

### Secondary Goals

**1. TORMENT EACH GUEST** (Plant Motives)

- **Helena:** Possessive control ("My dear wife...")
- **James:** Business threats (fraud discovery)
- **Daisy:** Body shaming ("That dress is... snug?")
- **Maria:** Lawsuit reminder ("Truth matters, doesn't it?")
- **Claire & Denise:** Ignore them (they don't exist to you publicly)
- **Others:** Backhanded compliments (subtle cruelty)

**2. APPEAR CHARMING** (Surface Level)

Everyone should think: "He's awful... but maybe I'm being sensitive?"

**3. EXIT GRACEFULLY** (20h09)

When Helena cues you ("Darling, surprise in the office"), exit smoothly.

---

## PHASE 2: CLARENCE'S GOALS (20h20-23h00)

### Primary Goal

**FACILITATE SMOOTH GAME FLOW**

You are Helena's (GM's) assistant. Help the game succeed.

---

### Secondary Goals

**1. STAY INVISIBLE** (Until Needed)

- Blend into background
- Serve drinks quietly
- Observe everything
- Take mental notes

**2. SUPPORT HELENA** (GM Assistance)

- If she needs something, provide it
- If a player is confused, guide gently
- If the game stalls, offer a prompt

**3. DELIVER TESTIMONY** (Act IV - 22h00)

When cued, step forward and deliver your memorized script. This is THE KEY MOMENT.

**4. ANSWER FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS** (Truthfully)

After testimony, remain available. Answer honestly but reluctantly.

## REMEMBER

**Phase 1 (Reggie):** You are the VILLAIN. Be hated.

**Phase 2 (Clarence):** You are the HERO. Speak truth.

**Both phases matter equally.**

Reggie plants the motives.

Clarence reveals the killers.

**You are the murder mystery's ENGINE.**

Make it work.
