# CLARENCE'S CRITICAL TESTIMONY

## THE TESTIMONY (Act IV - 22h00)

**⚠️ MEMORIZE THIS SCRIPT ⚠️**

This testimony solves the murder. Deliver it exactly as written.

---

### **CONTEXT**

Investigation has been ongoing. Suspects narrowed. Evidence mounting. JC (or Helena as GM) cues you: **"Clarence, did you see anything?"**

---

### **THE SCRIPT (EXACT)**

CLARENCE: [Steps forward, reluctant]

"I... I must speak, though it pains me greatly."

[Pause - formal, struggling]

"I have served this family for fifteen years. Loyalty is paramount to proper service. But..."

[Looks at Helena, then away]

"I witnessed certain events this evening. I did not understand their significance until now."

[Takes breath - formal recitation]

"At eight oh nine precisely, Mrs. Ashford led the master to his office. I observed this from the hallway. They were alone."

[Pause]

"At eight oh eight - one minute prior - I observed Mr. James Harrods. Near the office hallway. He appeared to be... waiting."

[Another pause - this is hard for him]

"At eight seventeen, Mrs. Ashford exited the office. Alone. She appeared pale. Distressed. She did not see me observing."

[Final pause - the damning part]

"Mr. Harrods entered the office shortly after Mrs. Ashford exited. At approximately eight twelve. I did not see him leave, as I was called to attend to other matters."

[Looks at JC]

"I did not think anything untoward at the time. The master often conducted business in his office. But given the circumstances..."

[Trails off - implications clear]

"I am sorry, madam." [To Helena] "But I cannot lie about what I witnessed."

## WHY THIS TESTIMONY MATTERS

**Timeline It Establishes:**
- **20h08:** James lurking near office (premeditation)
- **20h09:** Helena leads Reggie to office (lure)
- **20h12:** James enters office (assist with murder)
- **20h17:** Helena exits (after murder, before body moved)

**What It Proves:**
- Both had opportunity
- Both were present
- Timeline matches murder (20h11)
- Coordination suggests planning

**Impact:**
This testimony is THE KEY EVIDENCE that identifies killers. JC will use it to confront Helena + James.

## DELIVERY NOTES

- Soft but clear (everyone must hear)

## CLARENCE'S OTHER SECRETS

**What Clarence Knows (But Doesn't Reveal Unless Asked):**

1. **Helena has been tense for weeks** (noticed as butler)
2. **James visited manor more frequently recently** (suspicious)
3. **Reggie was threatening someone** (overheard phone call Dec 22)
4. **Helena asked about office lock** (Dec 23 - now makes sense)
5. **The murder weapon was from the study** (recognizes it if shown)

**If Asked Directly:**
Answer truthfully but reluctantly. "I... yes, I did notice that, sir."

---

## THE AFTERMATH (After Testimony)

**Immediate:**
- Step back to background
- Remain available for follow-up questions
- Watch Helena's reaction (pained - you betrayed her)
- Stay in character (this hurts you too)

**If Helena Confronts You:**
CLARENCE: "I am sorry, madam. I could not lie. Not about murder."

**If James Protests:**
CLARENCE: [Quiet, firm] "I only speak what I saw, sir. Nothing more."

## REMEMBER

**You are Clarence, not Ricardo:**
- Stay humble
- Stay formal
- Stay truthful
- This pains you, but duty > loyalty when murder is involved

**Your testimony solves the murder.**

That's your power.

That's your purpose.

**Use it well.**
