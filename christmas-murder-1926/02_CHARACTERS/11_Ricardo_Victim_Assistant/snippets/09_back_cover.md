## THE DUAL ROLE

You are the **ENGINE** of this murder mystery.

**As REGGIE (Phase 1):**  
You plant every motive. You make everyone hate you. You set up the murder.

**As CLARENCE (Phase 2):**  
You solve the murder. Your testimony identifies the killers. You reveal the truth.

---

## YOUR POWER

**Phase 1:** Without Reggie, there are no motives.

**Phase 2:** Without Clarence, there is no solution.

**Both phases matter equally.**

---

## THE TRANSFORMATION

**80% = POSTURE**

**Reggie:** BIG (chest out, chin up, loud, dominant)

**Clarence:** small (head bowed, hands behind back, quiet, humble)

Practice the physical shift. That's the key.

---

## YOUR MISSION

**Phase 1:** Be hated. Plant motives. Exit at 20h09.

**Phase 2:** Be invisible. Observe. Deliver testimony at 22h00.

**The testimony solves everything.**

---

## REMEMBER

This is the hardest role in the game.

You're playing TWO complete characters in one night.

But you're also the most important.

**Trust yourself.**

**Trust Helena (GM).**

**Make it unforgettable.**
