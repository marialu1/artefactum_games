## REGGIE - CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is Reginald Ashford III?**

**In Three Sentences:**

Reginald "Reggie" Ashford III is a **48-year-old textile magnate** who built his fortune through ruthless business practices, strategic marriages, and complete disregard for anyone standing in his way - a man who abandoned his own twin daughters at birth, destroyed careers for sport, and treats his wife Helena like a possession rather than a partner. He's **charming in public** (quick wit, generous host, magnetic personality) but **cruel in private** (emotional abuse, calculated cruelties, zero empathy), creating a perfect storm where absolutely everyone at his Christmas Eve party has a **legitimate reason to want him dead**. His murder at **20h11** is both tragic (a human life ended) and inevitable (he made too many enemies) - and as the victim, his job tonight is to **make that murder feel JUSTIFIED** to the audience.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Charming Monster"**

Reggie is NOT a cartoon villain. He's worse: **believably awful**. 

He tells jokes that make you laugh before you realize they were insults. He gives compliments that feel like slaps. He's generous (throws expensive parties) but cruel (uses them to humiliate guests). He loves his wife (obsessively possessive) but destroys her (emotional torture).

The paradox: You WANT to like him (charisma!) but you CAN'T (cruelty!). And that makes his murder feel... deserved.

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I must make everyone want me dead in 10 minutes. Be insufferable but not cartoonish. Plant motives. Then die gracefully and become a completely different character for the rest of the night. No pressure!"*

## CLARENCE - CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is Clarence Worthington?**

**In Three Sentences:**

Clarence Worthington is a **63-year-old English butler** who served the Ashford family for 15 years, embodying perfect Victorian service - formal, invisible, loyal to a fault. He's a **traditional servant** (calls employers "sir" and "madam," never offers opinions unsolicited, maintains professional distance) who **witnessed the murder** without realizing what he was seeing until the investigation forced him to piece together the timeline. His **testimony at 22h00** will be the **critical evidence** that identifies Helena and James as the killers - delivered reluctantly, formally, but truthfully, because even loyalty has limits when murder is involved.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Invisible Observer"**

Clarence spent 15 years being invisible - good servants don't draw attention, don't have opinions, don't exist as people. But invisibility = perfect witness. He saw EVERYTHING because no one noticed him watching.

The paradox: His job was to be unseen. But his testimony will be what everyone remembers.

### **Player Experience Goal (Phase 2)**

*"I must assist GM (Helena) with game logistics while staying in character as formal butler. Then at 22h00, I deliver the testimony that solves the murder. Balance meta-game management with in-character performance."*

---

## CLARENCE - CRITICAL TESTIMONY

### **THE TESTIMONY (Act IV - 22h00)**

**Context:**

Investigation has been ongoing. Suspects narrowed. Evidence mounting. JC (or Helena as GM) cues Clarence: "Did you see anything, Clarence?"

**THE SCRIPT (Memorize This):**

---

CLARENCE: [Steps forward, reluctant]

"I... I must speak, though it pains me greatly."

[Pause - formal, struggling]

"I have served this family for fifteen years. Loyalty is paramount to proper service. But..."

[Looks at Helena, then away]

"I witnessed certain events this evening. I did not understand their significance until now."

[Takes breath - formal recitation]

"At eight oh nine precisely, Mrs. Ashford led the master to his office. I observed this from the hallway. They were alone."

[Pause]

"At eight oh eight - one minute prior - I observed Mr. James Harrods. Near the office hallway. He appeared to be... waiting."

[Another pause - this is hard for him]

"At eight seventeen, Mrs. Ashford exited the office. Alone. She appeared pale. Distressed. She did not see me observing."

[Final pause - the damning part]

"Mr. Harrods entered the office shortly after Mrs. Ashford exited. At approximately eight twelve. I did not see him leave, as I was called to attend to other matters."

[Looks at JC]

"I did not think anything untoward at the time. The master often conducted business in his office. But given the circumstances..."

[Trails off - implications clear]

"I am sorry, madam." [To Helena] "But I cannot lie about what I witnessed."

---

**Why This Testimony Matters:**

**Timeline It Establishes:**
- 20h08: James lurking near office (premeditation)
- 20h09: Helena leads Reggie to office (lure)
- 20h12: James enters office (assist with murder)
- 20h17: Helena exits (after murder, before body moved)

**What It Proves:**
- Both had opportunity
- Both were present
- Timeline matches murder (20h11)
- Coordination suggests planning

**Impact:**

This testimony is THE KEY EVIDENCE that identifies killers. JC will use it to confront Helena + James.

---

## CLARENCE - GM ASSISTANT ROLE

### **YOUR DUAL RESPONSIBILITY**

As Clarence, you have TWO jobs:

**1. IN-CHARACTER:** Be butler, give testimony, stay formal  
**2. META-GAME:** Assist GM (Helena) with logistics

### **GM ASSISTANT TASKS**

**Throughout Acts II-V:**

**Clue Distribution:**
- If Helena needs clue delivered: "Pardon me, sir/madam, I discovered this..." [Hands clue to JC or player]

**Timing Management:**
- If act running long: Subtle signal to Helena (pre-arranged)
- If act too short: Stretch with butler activities

**Player Management:**
- If player confused: Gently guide ("Perhaps you'd like to examine...?")
- If player stuck: Subtle hint ("The master kept records in his desk...")

**Technical Issues:**
- Props misplaced: Retrieve quickly
- Costume malfunction: Assist discreetly
- Any logistical problem: Handle invisibly

**Testimony Timing:**
- Wait for Helena's cue (she controls pacing)
- If cued early: Ready to deliver
- If cued late: Patient, stay in character until needed

### **COMMUNICATION WITH GM**

**Pre-Arranged Signals (Decide with Helena):**

**Example:**
- Helena touches her ear = "Deliver testimony now"
- Helena looks at you directly = "Need assistance"
- Clarence straightens tie = "Act running long"

**Verbal Cues:**
- Helena: "Clarence, did you see anything?" = TESTIMONY TIME
- Helena: "Clarence, could you help with...?" = Meta-game task

---

## CLARENCE - PERFORMANCE GUIDE

### **ACT II-III: BACKGROUND PRESENCE (20h20-22h00)**

**Your Role:**

**Be Invisible:**
- Stand near walls (background)
- Hands behind back (formal)
- Watch silently (observe)
- Don't interrupt (unless needed)

**Be Helpful:**
- If players ask butler questions: Answer formally
- If GM needs assistance: Respond quickly
- If clue needed: Deliver it naturally

**Examples:**

PLAYER: "Clarence, where was your master earlier?"

CLARENCE: "The master retired to his office with Mrs. Ashford at eight oh nine, sir. I did not see him after that."

PLAYER: "Did anyone else go to the office?"

CLARENCE: [Pause - reluctant] "I... observed some movements, yes. But I hesitate to speak without certainty."

[This plants testimony without giving it too early]

---

### **ACT IV: THE TESTIMONY (22h00)**

**When Cued:**

**Setup:**

- If police called: "Shall I contact the authorities, sir?"

**Remain in character until END:**
- Game doesn't end until Helena (GM) says so

## BACK COVER & PLAYER NOTES

### **RICARDO'S CHALLENGE**

At 22h00, you will deliver the words that solve the murder.

Not JC (though he's investigator).

Not Helena (though she's GM).

**YOU.**

The butler saw everything.

The butler tells all.

And the killers are revealed.

**That's your power.**

**That's your purpose.**

**That's why Ricardo is essential.**

### **PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY**

> *"The victim makes everyone hate him.  \n> The butler makes everyone trust him.  \n> The victim dies dramatically.  \n> The butler speaks quietly.  \n> But the butler's words?  \n> Those are what matter."*

> *"I die in Act I.  \n> I solve the murder in Act IV.  \n> Not bad for a corpse."*

### **FINAL NOTE TO RICARDO**

**This role is HARD.**

Two characters. Quick change. Perfect testimony. GM duties.

But it's also ESSENTIAL.

Without you:
- No victim (no murder!)
- No testimony (no solution!)
- No GM assist (game falters!)

You are the most important player AND the most important support staff.

**That's incredible.**

**That's pressure.**

**That's also WHY YOU'RE RICARDO.**

Because you can handle it.

**Now go make us hate Reggie.**

**Then make us believe Clarence.**

**Then solve the murder.**

**We're counting on you.**
