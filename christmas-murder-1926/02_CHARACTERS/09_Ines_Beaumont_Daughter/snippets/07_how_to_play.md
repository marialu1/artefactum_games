# HOW TO PLAY

## CORE PERFORMANCE BALANCE

**You must seem:**

✅ **Guilty enough:** Justify suspicion (you had murder plan!)  
✅ **Innocent enough:** Because you ARE innocent (didn't execute)  
✅ **Conflicted always:** Internal war (good vs. bad)  
✅ **Protective of Denise:** Twin loyalty paramount

## SCENE-BY-SCENE GUIDE

### **ACT I: ARRIVAL (19h45-20h10)**

You arrive with Denise. Flask in purse. Heart pounding.

**Tonight's Plan:** Poison father. Get justice. Leave.

**Your State:**
- Terrified (can I really do this?)
- Determined (must do this)
- Nauseous (moral conflict physical)

**Performance:**
- Touch pearl necklace frequently
- Stay close to Denise
- Avoid eye contact with others
- Hand in purse (touching flask)

**Example Interaction:**

HELENA: "Miss Beaumont, so glad you could come."

INÊS: [Touches pearls] "Thank you for having us, Mrs. Ashford."

HELENA: "And your sister?"

INÊS: [Looks at Denise] "Yes, my twin. We're... inseparable now."

---

### **20h11-20h18: DURING ACTUAL MURDER**

You don't know it's happening.

You're in ballroom, watching Denise, touching flask in purse, building courage.

---

### **20h18: THE SCREAM**

HELENA: *"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!!"*

**Your Reaction:**

[Head snaps toward sound]

[Genuine confusion] "What...?"

[Runs with crowd]

[Sees body - FREEZES]

**Internal:** *"He's dead. Someone killed him. We didn't have to... I didn't have to... oh God..."*

**External:** [Whisper] "Is he...?"

[Looks at Denise - she's equally shocked - neither did it]

[Relief + horror + confusion]

---

### **ACT II-IV: INVESTIGATION**

Balance suspicion with innocence. Protect Denise. Navigate moral conflict.

**When Questioned:**

JC: "How did you know Mr. Ashford?"

INÊS: [Pause, touches pearls] "I... recently discovered he was my biological father."

JC: "And you only learned this when?"

INÊS: "Last month. November."

JC: "How did you feel about that discovery?"

INÊS: [Honest] "Angry. Betrayed. He abandoned my sister and me."

JC: "Angry enough to want him dead?"

INÊS: [Long pause - truth or lie?] "...Yes. I wanted him dead."

[Room reacts]

"But I didn't kill him."

---

### **IF LAUDANUM FOUND:**

JC: [Shows flask] "This was in your purse."

INÊS: [Goes pale, touches pearls] "I can explain..."

JC: "Laudanum. Lethal dose. You brought it to poison him?"

INÊS: [Quiet, tears forming] "...Yes. I planned to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why not?"

INÊS: "Because when it came time... I couldn't. I'm not a killer."

[Crying now, but composed]

"I wanted to be. I tried to be. But I'm not."

---

### **IF DENISE THREATENED:**

JC: "Your sister had the same motive. Did she—?"

INÊS: [Steps forward, protective] "She didn't do it! Neither of us did!"

JC: "How can you be sure?"

INÊS: "Because I know her. She's my sister. We're twins. I'd know."

[Fierce, no longer gentle]

"She's been through enough. Leave her alone."

---

### **ACT V: FINAL STATEMENT**

INÊS: "I came here to kill my father. I brought poison. I planned it with my sister. We wanted justice for what he did to us."

[Pause, looks around room]

"But when the moment came... I couldn't. Not because he didn't deserve it. But because I'm not a killer. I thought I could be. I was wrong."

[Looks at investigators]

"Someone else killed him. I don't know who. But part of me... part of me is grateful. Because they saved me from becoming something I'm not."

**Play the moral conflict externally.**

Your struggle IS your performance.
