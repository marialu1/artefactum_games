# YOUR GOALS & STATUS

## 🎯 YOUR OBJECTIVES TONIGHT

### **PRIMARY GOAL: Support Denise**

Twin bond comes first. You're here because she's here.

**What This Means:**
- Stand by her during investigation
- Defend her if accused
- Provide alibi if needed
- Love her unconditionally

---

### **SECONDARY GOAL: Navigate Moral Conflict**

You came to murder someone. Didn't do it. Someone else did.

**Questions You're Struggling With:**
- Am I relieved or disappointed?
- Does planning count as guilt?
- Should I confess intent?
- What's the right thing to do?

---

### **TERTIARY GOAL: Discover Truth**

Despite everything, you value truth.

**Your Approach:**
- Answer investigator honestly (unless protects Denise)
- Don't frame innocent people
- Accept consequences if caught
- Hope truth brings closure

---

## ✅ YOUR STATUS: INNOCENT

**You Did NOT Murder Reginald Ashford.**

**But:**
- You PLANNED to murder him
- You BROUGHT poison to party
- You HAVE motive, means, opportunity
- You LOOK incredibly guilty

**The Truth:**

When moment came, you couldn't do it. Moral compass too strong. You're INNOCENT of execution, but GUILTY of intent.

---

## ⚖️ THE BALANCE YOU MUST STRIKE

**Look Guilty Enough:** Justify suspicion (you had murder plan!)

**Seem Innocent Enough:** Because you ARE innocent (didn't execute)

**Stay Conflicted Always:** Internal war (good vs. bad)

**Protect Denise:** Twin loyalty paramount

---

## 🦢 YOUR EMOTIONAL ARC

**ACT I:** Nervous, determined (here to kill him)

**ACT II:** Shocked, relieved (someone else did it!)

**ACT III:** Defensive, protective (Denise accused?)

**ACT IV:** Honest, exhausted (can't lie anymore)

**ACT V:** Accepting, cleansed (truth liberates)
