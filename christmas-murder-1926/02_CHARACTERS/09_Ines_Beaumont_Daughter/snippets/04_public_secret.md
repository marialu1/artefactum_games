# YOUR PUBLIC SECRET

## WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Recent Discovery:**
- "I recently discovered I'm adopted." (TRUE)
- "Only found out six weeks ago." (November 1926)
- "It's been... quite a shock."

✅ **Twin Reunion:**
- "I have a twin sister I never knew existed." (TRUE)
- "We were separated at birth."
- "Denise is here tonight too." (Gesture to her)
- "We've been inseparable since reuniting."

✅ **Party Attendance:**
- "Mrs. Ashford invited me through charity circles."
- "This is my first time meeting her husband."
- "I'm here primarily to support Denise."

## WHY THIS IS USEFUL

**Strategic Value:**

1. **Establishes Backstory** - Dramatic discovery explains your presence
2. **Creates Sympathy** - Adopted, separated twin = tragic story
3. **Explains Connection** - Why two strangers at party
4. **Doesn't Reveal Motive** - Father's identity still secret initially

## HOW TO DELIVER

**When Asked About Connection to Ashfords:**

INÊS: [Touches pearls] "I... well, it's complicated. Mrs. Ashford and I met through charity work. She was kind enough to invite both my sister and me."

[Pause]

"My twin sister, Denise. We were separated at birth. Only found each other six weeks ago. It's been... overwhelming."

[Soft smile]

"But having her here tonight, it makes me feel less alone."

## WHAT TO KEEP HIDDEN (For Now)

❌ Father's identity (Reginald Ashford)  
❌ Murder plan with Denise  
❌ Laudanum in purse  
❌ Intent to poison him  
❌ Anger/rage at father

**These come out LATER - during interrogation, if pressed, or when confronted with evidence.**
