# RELATIONSHIPS

## YOUR KEY DYNAMICS

---

### 🔴 **DENISE BEAUMONT** *(Twin Sister/Co-Conspirator/Priority)*

**Connection:** Twin, separated at birth, reunited November 1926

**Your Feelings:**
- **Love:** Instant, deep, biological
- **Guilt:** "Why did I get the good life and she didn't?"
- **Loyalty:** Fierce, protective, unconditional
- **Conflict:** She wants revenge, you want morality

**Dynamic - "Good Twin" vs. "Bad Twin":**

DENISE: [Aggressive] "He deserves to die."

INÊS: [Gentle] "But is it right for us to do it?"

DENISE: "Right? He PAID to separate us!"

INÊS: "I know. I'm angry too. But murder..."

DENISE: "Are you with me or not?"

INÊS: [Torn] "I'm with you. Always. But I'm scared."

**If She's Accused:**

INÊS: [Steps forward] "She didn't do it!"

JC: "How can you be sure?"

INÊS: "Because I know her. She's my sister. We're twins. I'd know."

**Your Ultimate Dilemma:** Truth vs. Twin Loyalty

### 🔴 **REGINALD ASHFORD** *(Biological Father/Victim)*

**Connection:** Father who abandoned you, paid to separate you from twin

**Your Feelings:**
- **Hatred:** For abandonment, separation, mother's death
- **Grief:** For lost relationship, never knowing him
- **Confusion:** "Do I hate him? Miss him? Both?"
- **Relief:** When he dies (complicated, guilt-inducing relief)

**You Never Met Him Alive:**

Planned to confront him at party. He died before confrontation.

**After His Death:**

INÊS: [To Denise] "I thought I'd feel satisfied. But I just feel... empty."

### 🟡 **JC MENDES** *(Investigator/Interrogator)*

**Connection:** Detective investigating murder, will question you

**Your Feelings:**
- **Fear:** He'll discover laudanum, murder plan
- **Respect:** Kind investigator (not aggressive)
- **Guilt:** Want to tell truth (but must protect Denise)

**Interrogation Approach:**

JC: [Gentle] "I know you're adopted. I know you recently found your twin. I know you've been investigating your birth parents."

INÊS: [Tears] "How did you...?"

JC: "I'm a detective. That's what I do. Did you discover who your father was?"

INÊS: [Whisper] "Yes."

JC: "And was it Mr. Ashford?"

INÊS: [Nods, crying] "He abandoned us. Paid to keep us apart."

JC: "That must have made you very angry."

INÊS: "Yes. I wanted... I wanted to hurt him."

JC: "Did you?"

INÊS: [Looks up] "No. Someone else did it first."

### 🟡 **HELENA ASHFORD** *(Stepmother? / Actual Killer)*

**Connection:** Father's wife (though you don't acknowledge relationship)

**Your Perspective:**
- Initially: Polite acquaintance (charity circles)
- Learning Helena is father's wife: Complicated feelings
- After murder revealed: Shock that Helena did it

**Interaction After Murder Revealed:**

INÊS: "You... you killed him?"

HELENA: [Quiet] "Yes."

INÊS: "Why?"

HELENA: "For love. And freedom."

INÊS: [Processing] "I wanted to kill him too. But I couldn't. How did you?"

### 🟡 **EMILIA HARRODS** *(Innocent Victim/Kindred Spirit)*

**Connection:** Potential friendship (both kind-hearted)

**Your Perspective:**
- Recognize pain in Emilia (kindred spirit)
- Sympathize when truth emerges (husband's betrayal)
- Try to comfort (instinctive helper)

**Potential Scene After Emilia Learns of Affair:**

INÊS: [Approaches gently] "Mrs. Harrods..."

EMILIA: [Broken] "Don't. Please."

INÊS: "I just wanted to say... I understand pain. Not this exact pain. But... loss. Betrayal."

EMILIA: [Looks at her] "How do you survive it?"

INÊS: [Honest] "I don't know yet. I only found out a month ago that my life was a lie too."

EMILIA: "What did you do?"

INÊS: "I planned to kill the person who hurt me. But I couldn't. I'm glad now. Because this..." [Gestures to chaos] "...isn't worth it."

---

### 🟢 **OTHERS** *(Brief Interactions)*

**James Harrods:** None (strangers) - Surprised he's killer

**Filipp, Father Juan Carlos, Maria, Daisy:** Minimal interaction. You're polite, gentle, but focused on twin and internal conflict.

---

## YOUR RELATIONAL PRIORITY

**1. DENISE** - Twin loyalty comes first  
**2. TRUTH** - Moral compass demands honesty  
**3. OTHERS** - Kind to everyone, but withdrawn

**The Conflict:** When protecting Denise requires lying to JC
