# INÊS BEAUMONT
**The Good Twin Who Couldn't**

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Your Role:** Innocent (Strong Suspect - RED HERRING)

**Your Challenge:** Look guilty while being innocent. Protect twin. Navigate moral conflict.

**Your Method:** Honesty (when it doesn't hurt Denise)

---

## THE BALANCE

**Seem Guilty:** You brought poison, had plan, strong motive

**Actually Innocent:** Couldn't execute when moment came

**Always Conflicted:** Internal war (good vs. bad) external

**Protect Denise:** Twin loyalty paramount

---

## CORE PERFORMANCE

**Physical Tells:**
- Touch pearl necklace (anxiety)
- Perfect posture breaks (genuine emotion)
- Quiet crying (internalized pain)

**Emotional Arc:**
- ACT I: Nervous, determined
- ACT II: Shocked, relieved
- ACT III: Defensive, protective
- ACT IV: Honest, exhausted

## THE TRUTH

**You did NOT kill him.**

**But you PLANNED to.**

**Laudanum in purse. Murder intent. Strong motive.**

**When moment came: couldn't do it.**

**Moral compass too strong.**

---

## KEY RELATIONSHIPS

🔴 **DENISE** - Twin, co-conspirator, priority #1

🔴 **REGGIE** - Father who abandoned you (victim)

🟡 **JC** - Investigator (fear + respect + guilt)

🟡 **HELENA** - Actual killer (surprise when revealed)

🟡 **EMILIA** - Kindred spirit (both betrayed)

---

## IF INTERROGATED

**About Motive:**
"Yes, I wanted him dead. He abandoned us. Paid to keep us apart. But I didn't kill him."

**If Laudanum Found:**
"I planned to. I brought poison. But when it came time... I couldn't. I'm not a killer."

**If Denise Threatened:**
"She didn't do it! Neither of us did! Leave her alone!"

## REMEMBER

✅ You're INNOCENT but LOOK GUILTY

✅ Planned murder but didn't execute

✅ Moral conflict = your performance

✅ Twin loyalty vs. truth = ultimate choice

✅ Play the internal war externally

✅ Touch pearls when nervous (signature tell)

✅ Defend Denise fiercely (priority)

✅ Honest when it doesn't hurt her

## FOR PLAYER: CLAIRE

This role requires balance.

Guilty enough to justify suspicion.

Innocent enough because you ARE.

Conflicted always (good vs. bad).

Protective of Denise (twin bond).

Your struggle IS your performance.

Play the moral conflict externally.

When you confess intent but not execution?

When you protect Denise despite truth?

When you choose honesty even when it costs?

**That's Claire.**

**That's your role.**

*"I wanted to be strong enough to kill him. But I was only strong enough to choose not to. Maybe that's stronger."*
