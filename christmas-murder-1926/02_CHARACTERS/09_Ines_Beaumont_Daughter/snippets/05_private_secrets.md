# YOUR PRIVATE SECRETS

## 🔴 SECRET #1: THE TWIN SEPARATION

**Born January 12, 1900:** Mother Martha died in childbirth giving birth to twins (you and Denise).

**Father's Choice:** Reginald Ashford (age 22) abandoned both babies at orphanage. Paid $1,000 to orphanage to:
- Keep twins separated
- Never tell them about each other
- Facilitate separate adoptions
- Erase his name from records

**Your Path:** Adopted within weeks by wealthy Beaumonts. Privileged upbringing (Upper East Side, private schools, finishing school).

**Denise's Path:** Stayed in orphanage (harsh conditions, poverty). Different lives entirely.

**Why This Hurts:** He PAID to destroy your chance at family. Deliberate cruelty, not just abandonment.

## 🔴 SECRET #2: THE REUNION (November 5, 1926)

**How You Met:** Charity event. Walked past mirror. Saw "reflection" in different dress. Turned. IDENTICAL TWIN.

**The Investigation:** Hired private investigator together. Discovered:
- Mother: Martha Beaumont (died giving birth)
- Father: Reginald Ashford (abandoned you, paid to separate you)

**November 20, 1926:** Former orphanage worker revealed father's identity and payment.

**Your Reaction:** 
- Shock → Grief → RAGE
- "He PAID to keep us apart?"
- "Our mother died. And he just... erased us."

**Denise:** "I want to kill him."

**You:** [Quiet] "...So do I."

## 🔴 SECRET #3: THE MURDER PLAN

**December 10, 1926:** You and Denise planned his murder.

**The Method:** Poison (laudanum - opium tincture, deadly in high dose)

**You Acquired It:** December 18 - pharmacy, said it was for adopted mother's insomnia. Flask in your purse tonight.

**The Plan:**
- Arrive at party
- Slip laudanum into his drink
- He dies (appears natural)
- Leave before investigation

**Tonight (20h00-20h10):** You were in ballroom, touching flask in purse, building courage.

**20h18 - THE SCREAM:** Someone else killed him first.

**Your Reaction:** Shock + Relief + Confusion (didn't have to do it, someone else did)

**The Problem:** LAUDANUM STILL IN PURSE. If found = prime suspect.

## 🔴 SECRET #4: YOU COULDN'T DO IT

**The Truth:** When moment came, you couldn't execute plan.

**Not because he didn't deserve it.**

**But because:** "Killing him would kill something in me. The goodness I'd carried for 26 years."

**You're innocent of murder.**

**But guilty of intent.**

## IF INTERROGATED

**If Laudanum Found:**

JC: [Shows flask] "This was in your purse."

INÊS: [Pale] "I can explain..."

JC: "Laudanum. Lethal dose. You brought it to poison him?"

INÊS: [Quiet] "...Yes. I planned to. But I didn't."

JC: "Why not?"

INÊS: "Because when it came time... I couldn't. I'm not a killer."

**If Asked About Motive:**

INÊS: "I recently discovered he was my biological father."

JC: "How did you feel about that discovery?"

INÊS: [Honest] "Angry. Betrayed. He abandoned my sister and me. Paid to keep us apart."

JC: "Angry enough to want him dead?"

INÊS: [Pause] "...Yes. I wanted him dead."

[Room reacts]

"But I didn't kill him."

## THE MORAL CONFLICT

**What You Struggle With:**
- Wanted revenge (justified rage)
- Couldn't execute (moral compass too strong)
- Relieved someone else did it (makes you complicit?)
- Protecting Denise vs. telling truth (loyalty vs. honesty)

**Your Internal War:** "Am I grateful? Disappointed? Guilty? Innocent? What am I?"
