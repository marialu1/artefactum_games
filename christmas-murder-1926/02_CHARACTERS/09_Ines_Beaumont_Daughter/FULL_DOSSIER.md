## CHARACTER ESSENCE

### **Who Is Claire Beaumont?**

**In Three Sentences:**

Claire Beaumont is a **26-year-old woman** raised by a wealthy adopted family who only discovered **six weeks ago** that she has a **twin sister** she never knew existed - separated at birth when their biological father abandoned them both at an orphanage. She spent the past month learning that her father is **Reginald Ashford**, a man who paid to keep the twins separated and never acknowledged their existence, and while she joined her sister Denise in **planning his murder**, she ultimately **couldn't go through with it** - her moral compass too strong to cross that final line. She's **INNOCENT of the actual murder**, but her presence at the party with laudanum in her purse and revenge in her heart makes her a **prime suspect** in an investigation that will force her to choose between loyalty to her twin and loyalty to the truth.

### **Core Paradox**

**"The Good Girl Who Wanted to Be Bad"**

Claire was raised with privilege, morals, and expectations. She's kind, thoughtful, empathetic - the type who helps old ladies cross streets and volunteers at charity events. But discovering her father's abandonment awakened something dark: rage, betrayal, a desire for revenge. She WANTED to kill him. Planned it with Denise. But when the moment came... she couldn't. Not because he didn't deserve it, but because **she couldn't live with becoming a murderer**. The paradox: wanting darkness but being too good to embrace it.

### **Player Experience Goal**

*"I must look guilty (motive, means, opportunity) while being innocent. Navigate twin loyalty vs. truth. Struggle with moral conflict publicly. And ultimately... maybe learn I'm grateful I didn't have to do it myself."*

## PUBLIC SECRET

### WHAT YOU CAN REVEAL FREELY

**From ACT I onwards, you may state openly:**

✅ **Recent Discovery:**
- "I recently discovered I'm adopted." (TRUE)
- "Only found out six weeks ago." (November 1926)
- "It's been... quite a shock."

✅ **Twin Reunion:**
- "I have a twin sister I never knew existed." (TRUE)
- "We were separated at birth."
- "Denise is here tonight too." (Gesture to her)
- "We've been inseparable since reuniting."

✅ **Party Attendance:**
- "Mrs. Ashford invited me through charity circles."
- "This is my first time meeting her husband."
- "I'm here primarily to support Denise."

### STRATEGIC USE

**Why This Is Useful:**

1. **Establishes Backstory** (Dramatic discovery = explains presence)
2. **Creates Sympathy** (Adopted, separated twin = tragic)
3. **Explains Connection** (Why two strangers at party)
4. **Doesn't Reveal Motive** (Father's identity still secret initially)

**Delivery:**

[When asked about connection to Ashfords]

INÊS: "I... well, it's complicated. Mrs. Ashford and I met through charity work. She was kind enough to invite both my sister and me."

[Pause, touches pearls]

"My twin sister, Denise. We were separated at birth. Only found each other six weeks ago. It's been... overwhelming."

[Soft smile]

"But having her here tonight, it makes me feel less alone."

## PRIVATE SECRETS

### 🔴 SECRET #1: THE TWIN SEPARATION (1900)

**THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING**

#### **Birth & Tragedy (January 12, 1900)**

**The Context:**

**Reginald Ashford, age 22:**
- Young, unmarried, reckless
- Affair with Martha Beaumont (working-class woman)
- She got pregnant (scandal potential)
- He didn't love her (momentary passion only)

**Martha Beaumont:**
- 19 years old, seamstress
- In love with Reggie (he wasn't with her)
- Pregnancy discovered too late (no options)
- Reggie refused to marry her

**January 12, 1900 - The Birth:**

Labor complicated. Twins. Double strain.

**First baby:** Claire (healthy, crying)

**Second baby:** Denise (healthy, crying)

**Mother:** Martha (hemorrhaging, dying)

**Doctor:** "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do."

**Martha's last words:** "My babies... please... keep them together..."

[Dies.]

**Reggie's reaction:** Horror. Two babies. Dead woman. His responsibility.

**His solution:** Abandon them.

#### **The Separation (January 1900)**

**Reggie's Plan:**

Take babies to orphanage. Pay them to:
1. Keep twins separated (don't let them know about each other)
2. Facilitate adoptions separately (maximize chances of placement)
3. Never mention father's name (erase him from their history)
4. Burn all records (no paper trail)

**Payment:** $1,000 (massive bribe for 1900)

**Orphanage Director:** Agreed. (Corruption common.)

**The Separation:**

- **Claire:** Listed as "Baby Girl A" - No twin mentioned
- **Denise:** Listed as "Baby Girl B" - No twin mentioned
- Different cribs, different wings
- Never told they had sister

**Why This Worked:**

Babies too young to remember. Records destroyed. No one questioned it. Money solves everything.

#### **Claire's Path (1900-1926)**

**Within Weeks:**

**Charles & Eleanor Beaumont:**
- Wealthy industrialists
- Childless (Eleanor infertile)
- Desperate for baby daughter
- Saw "Baby Girl A" (Claire): perfect

**Adoption:** Immediate. Legal. Complete.

**Name:** Claire Claire Beaumont

**Upbringing (1900-1926):**

- Upper East Side mansion
- Private schools (best education)
- Finishing school (deportment, arts, refinement)
- Travel (Europe, culture)
- Charity work (taught to give back)
- Piano lessons (accomplished musician)
- Art classes (watercolors, delicate hobby)
- Expectations: Marry well, continue family legacy

**What She Was Told:**

"You're adopted. We chose you because we loved you the moment we saw you."

**What She Wasn't Told:**

- Twin sister exists
- Biological mother died in childbirth
- Father is Reginald Ashford
- Separation was intentional

**Her Childhood:**

Privileged but always felt... incomplete. Like something missing. Couldn't explain it. Dismissed as "just how I feel sometimes."

**Now realizes:** Twin separation = literal missing piece.

---

### 🔴 SECRET #2: THE REUNION (November 1926)

**THE DISCOVERY THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING**

#### **How It Happened (November 5, 1926)**

**The Setting:**

Charity event. Upper East Side. Claire volunteering (as usual).

**The Moment:**

Walking past mirror. Sees reflection.

Except... reflection wearing DIFFERENT dress.

Turns. Woman standing there. **IDENTICAL FACE.**

Both freeze. Staring.

**The Recognition:**

Not mirror. **TWIN.**

**The Meeting:**

INÊS: [Whisper] "Who... who are you?"

DENISE: [Equally shocked] "I could ask you the same thing."

[Both staring]

INÊS: "You look exactly like..."

DENISE: "Like you. Yeah. I noticed."

[Pause]

INÊS: "Do you think we're...?"

DENISE: "Twins. Has to be."

**The Conversation:**

They found private room. Talked for HOURS.

Compared:
- Birth date (January 12, 1900 - SAME)
- Birth location (Manhattan - SAME)
- Adoption/orphanage (different paths - EXPLAINED)
- Feeling of missing something (BOTH felt it)

**Conclusion:** They're twins. Separated at birth.

#### **The Investigation (November 5-30, 1926)**

**What They Did:**

**Denise** had orphanage records (basic, but had date/location)

**Claire** had adoption papers (sealed, but connections)

Together: Hired private investigator.

**What They Discovered:**

**November 15, 1926:**

PI returns with findings:

"Your mother: Martha Beaumont. Died January 12, 1900 giving birth to you two."

"Your father: Unknown officially. But orphanage had destroyed records. Someone paid them. Large sum."

"I tracked down former employee. Retired, willing to talk for money."

**November 20, 1926:**

Former orphanage worker reveals:

"Man came. Young, wealthy, terrified. Had two babies. Said their mother died. Paid us to separate them. Never tell them about each other."

"His name? Reginald Ashford."

**The Revelation:**

Their father: Reggie. 

Not just abandoned them. **PAID** to keep them apart.

**Claire's Reaction:**

[Sitting in PI's office, reading report]

[Hands shaking]

"He... he PAID? To separate us?"

DENISE: [Furious] "Not just abandoned. Deliberately destroyed our chance at family."

INÊS: [Tears] "Our mother died. And he... he just erased us."

DENISE: "I want to kill him."

INÊS: [Quiet] "...So do I."

#### **Processing the Truth (November-December 1926)**

**Claire's Emotional Journey:**

**Week 1:** Shock. Disbelief. "This can't be real."

**Week 2:** Grief. For mother she never knew. For 26 lost years with twin.

**Week 3:** Rage. At father. At orphanage. At injustice.

**Week 4:** Plotting. "What do we do about this?"

**The Moral Conflict:**

Claire raised with values:
- Forgiveness
- Charity
- Turning other cheek

But this?

Her MOTHER dead because of him.  
Her TWIN lost for 26 years because of him.  
He PAID to keep them apart.

**Her Struggle:**

"Mother (adopted) taught me revenge is wrong. But is this revenge? Or justice?"

"He destroyed our lives. Doesn't he deserve consequences?"

"If I do this... can I live with myself?"

"If I DON'T... can I live with NOT doing it?"

---

### 🔴 SECRET #3: THE MURDER PLAN (December 1926)

**THE PLAN THEY MADE (BUT DIDN'T EXECUTE)**

#### **The Decision (December 10, 1926)**

**Denise:** "I'm going to kill him."

**Claire:** [Pause] "How?"

**Denise:** [Surprised she's asking] "You'd help?"

**Claire:** [Quiet] "I want to. I think. Maybe. I don't know."

**The Planning:**

Over next two weeks, they strategized:

**The Method:** Poison (quiet, less violent than stabbing/shooting)

**The Substance:** Laudanum (opium tincture - legal, available, deadly in high dose)

**The Opportunity:** Christmas Eve party at Gatsby Rose Manor

**The How:** 
- Get invited to party (Denise blackmails Reggie, demands invitations)
- Slip laudanum into his drink
- He dies (appears natural - heart attack, overdose, accident)
- They leave (no direct connection)

**Who Does It:**

DENISE: "I'll do it. You don't have to."

INÊS: "No. We're in this together. Twins."

DENISE: "You sure? You're not like me."

INÊS: "Maybe I need to be. Just this once."

#### **Acquiring the Laudanum**

**December 18, 1926:**

INÊS: Goes to pharmacy.

"I need laudanum. For my adopted mother. She has terrible insomnia."

PHARMACIST: "Prescription?"

INÊS: "Her doctor prescribed it verbally. Dr. Morrison."

PHARMACIST: [Knows Beaumont family - wealthy, trustworthy] "Of course, Miss Beaumont."

[Sells her large bottle]

**The Flask:**

Claire transfers laudanum to small decorative flask. Hides in beaded purse.

Enough to kill several people. Lethal dose: 2-3 tablespoons.

#### **The Night (December 24, 1926)**

**The Plan:**

**19h45:** Arrive at party with Denise

**20h00-20h30:** Mingle, establish presence, appear normal

**20h30:** Denise distracts Reggie, brings him drink

**20h31:** Claire slips laudanum into drink (while Denise blocks view)

**20h32:** Reggie drinks (slowly, over next 30 minutes)

**21h00:** Reggie starts feeling effects (drowsy, confused)

**21h15:** Reggie collapses (death or near-death)

**21h20:** Twins leave (before investigation begins)

**What Actually Happened:**

**20h00-20h10:** Mingling. Claire keeps touching flask in purse. Nervous.

**20h11:** Helena leads Reggie to office. (Twins don't see this.)

**20h11-20h18:** Reggie is MURDERED (by James & Helena - twins don't know)

**20h18:** SCREAM. Reggie found dead.

**Claire's Reaction:**

[Hears scream]

[Runs to ballroom]

[Sees body in punch bowl]

**Internal:** *"Oh my God. Someone killed him. Someone actually... we didn't have to... someone else...?"*

**External:** [Genuine shock] "What happened?!"

**The Relief:**

Part of her is HORRIFIED (murder is real, not abstract).

Part of her is RELIEVED (didn't have to do it herself).

Part of her is GRATEFUL (someone else had courage she lacked).

#### **The Laudanum Problem**

**Still in her purse.**

**If found:**

- Evidence of murder intent
- Prime suspect (had means)
- Must explain why she brought it

**Her Dilemma:**

Should she:
1. **Admit it:** "Yes, I planned to kill him. But didn't. Someone else did first."
2. **Hide it:** Dispose of flask, deny everything
3. **Partial truth:** "Brought for protection? Self-defense?" (Weak)

**What She Decides:**

Depends on interrogation pressure. She wants to be honest. But also protect Denise.

- You BROUGHT poison to party
- You HAVE motive, means, opportunity
- You LOOK incredibly guilty

**The Truth:**

When moment came, you couldn't do it. Moral compass too strong. You're INNOCENT of execution, but GUILTY of intent.

---

## HOW TO PLAY

*(Complete performance guide with scene-by-scene instructions)*

### PART 1: CORE PERFORMANCE

**The Balance:**

You must seem:
- **Guilty enough:** Justify suspicion (you had murder plan!)
- **Innocent enough:** Because you ARE innocent (didn't execute)
- **Conflicted always:** Internal war (good vs. bad)
- **Protective of Denise:** Twin loyalty paramount

**Your Emotional Arc:**

**Act I:** Nervous, determined (here to kill him)  
**Act II:** Shocked, relieved (someone else did it!)  
**Act III:** Defensive, protective (Denise accused?)  
**Act IV:** Honest, exhausted (can't lie anymore)  
**Act V:** Accepting, cleansed (truth liberates)

---

### PART 2: SCENE-BY-SCENE PERFORMANCE

*(Coming to party, during murder, investigation, confrontation, resolution)*

**ACT I: ARRIVAL (19h45-20h10)**

You arrive with Denise. Flask in purse. Heart pounding.

**Tonight's Plan:** Poison father. Get justice. Leave.

**Your State:**
- Terrified (can I really do this?)
- Determined (must do this)
- Nauseous (moral conflict physical)

**Interaction Example:**

HELENA: "Miss Beaumont, so glad you could come."

INÊS: [Touches pearls] "Thank you for having us, Mrs. Ashford."

HELENA: "And your sister?"

INÊS: [Looks at Denise] "Yes, my twin. We're... inseparable now."

---

**20h11-20h18: DURING ACTUAL MURDER**

You don't know it's happening.

You're in ballroom, watching Denise, touching flask in purse, building courage.

---

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

HELENA: *\"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!\"*

**Your Reaction:**

[Head snaps toward sound]

[Genuine confusion] "What...?"

[Runs with crowd]

[Sees body - FREEZES]

**Internal:** *"He's dead. Someone killed him. We didn't have to... I didn't have to... oh God..."*

**External:** [Whisper] "Is he...?"

[Looks at Denise - she's equally shocked - neither did it]

[Relief + horror + confusion]

---

**ACT II-IV: INVESTIGATION**

Balance suspicion with innocence. Protect Denise. Navigate moral conflict.

**When Questioned:**

JC: "How did you know Mr. Ashford?"

INÊS: [Pause] "I... recently discovered he was my biological father."

JC: "And you only learned this when?"

INÊS: "Last month. November."

JC: "How did you feel about that discovery?"

INÊS: [Honest] "Angry. Betrayed. He abandoned my sister and me."

JC: "Angry enough to want him dead?"

INÊS: [Pause - truth or lie?] "...Yes. I wanted him dead."

[Room reacts]

"But I didn't kill him."

---

**ACT V: RESOLUTION**

**If Laudanum Found:**

Admit everything. Intent, plan, reason. But truth: didn't execute.

**If Denise Threatened:**

Defend her fiercely. Take blame if necessary (though both innocent of actual murder).

**Final Statement:**

INÊS: "I came here to kill my father. I brought poison. I planned it with my sister. We wanted justice for what he did to us."

[Pause]

"But when the moment came... I couldn't. Not because he didn't deserve it. But because I'm not a killer. I thought I could be. I was wrong."

[Looks at investigators]

"Someone else killed him. I don't know who. But part of me... part of me is grateful. Because they saved me from becoming something I'm not."

## BACK COVER

### 🦢 CLOSING REFLECTION

**The Good Twin Who Wanted To Be Bad**

Claire spent 26 years being good.

Good daughter. Good student. Good charity volunteer.

Then learned her father abandoned her.

Separated her from her twin.

Paid to erase them from his life.

And she thought: "Maybe I should be bad. Just this once."

So she planned murder.

With her twin, who knew how to be tough, she learned to be hard.

She brought poison. She prepared herself. She walked into that party ready to kill.

But when the moment came...

She couldn't.

Not because she forgave him.

But because killing him would kill something in her.

The goodness she'd carried for 26 years.

Turns out, you can't just decide to be different.

You are who you are.

Even when you wish you weren't.

And Claire is good.

Even when she doesn't want to be.

Even when good feels weak.

Even when bad would feel like justice.

She's good.

And that's her tragedy.

And her salvation.

> But hating someone and killing them...

> An ocean I couldn't cross."*

> *"My sister is tough. She survived the orphanage.  
> I survived being loved.  
> Different prisons. Different escapes.  
> But we're still twins. Still connected.  
> That will never change."*

> *"They say revenge is sweet.  
> But I think revenge is bitter.  
> And justice? Justice is complicated.  
> And forgiveness? I'm not there yet.  
> Maybe I never will be.  
> And maybe that's okay."*

### 🎭 FINAL NOTE TO PLAYER

**CLAIRE:**

Claire is the moral heart struggling with darkness.

Play her internal war externally:
- Touches pearls when anxious
- Looks to Denise for strength
- Tears when overwhelmed
- Honesty when it costs

She's not weak because she couldn't kill.

She's strong because she chose not to.

Even when choosing meant letting evil win.

That's the hardest kind of strength.

**That's Claire.**

**That's your role.**

**Play her beautifully broken.**
