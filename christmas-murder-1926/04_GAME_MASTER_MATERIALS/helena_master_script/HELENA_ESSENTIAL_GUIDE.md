## 🎭 PART 1: WHO HELENA IS

### Background (Essential Facts)

**Born:** 1898, Boston. Father died 1910, mother 1915.  
**Ages 18-22:** Alone, poor, worked as governess.  
**1922 (age 24):** Married Reginald Ashford.

**The Marriage (1922-1926):**
- **Public:** Perfect wife, elegant hostess, grateful
- **Private:** Financial control ($20/week allowance), emotional abuse, no freedom
- **Reality:** Prisoner in gilded cage

**The Affair (Dec 1925 - Dec 1926):**
- Met James Harrods Dec 1925
- Fell in love (first time feeling alive)
- 2-3 meetings/week, Brooklyn apartment
- Fantasy: Run away to Paris

**The Hidden Inheritance:**
- Grandmother Whitmore died 1925
- Left Helena $80,000
- Reggie INTERCEPTED documents, HID inheritance
- Helena never knew she was rich
- Could've divorced, been free = **murder was unnecessary**

---

## 🔪 PART 2: THE CRIME

### Why They Killed Him (Dec 20, 1926)

**James's Problem:**
- Stock fraud discovered
- Reggie had proof: $15k, 10 years prison
- Arrest planned Dec 26

**Helena's Problem:**
- Reggie hired detective (knew about affair)
- Divorce planned (she gets $0 due to pre-nup)
- Lose James forever

**The Decision:**
> "What if he wasn't alive to do it?"

They chose murder because they believed **no other option existed** (wrong - the inheritance existed but they didn't know).

---

### How It Happened (Dec 24, 20h09-20h18)

**20h09:** Helena leads Reggie to office ("surprise for you")  
**20h10:** James waiting behind curtain  
**20h11:** Both attack with piano wire (40 seconds of strangulation)  
**20h11-20h14:** Quick cleanup, remove gloves (forgot to retrieve - left in drawer = CLUE)  
**20h14-20h15:** Wait for Daisy's second song  
**20h15-20h16:** Drag body to ballroom, stage in punch bowl, jam star in head  
**20h16-20h17:** Helena fixes appearance, practices "discovery" reaction  
**20h18:** **"REEEGGIIEEE!"** scream, chaos, investigation begins

**True Cause of Death:** Strangulation (BEFORE punch)  
**Staging:** Drowning + star (misdirection)

## 🎭 PART 3: HOW TO PERFORM

### The 3 Layers (Act Simultaneously)

**SURFACE (Everyone Sees):**
- Shocked widow
- Trembling, tears, "I don't understand..."
- Trust JC, helpful but fragile

**MICRO-TELLS (Subtle - Act III+):**
- Glance at James too long → catch yourself
- Flinch when "office" mentioned
- Avoid Emilia's eyes (guilt)
- Hand to throat when "strangulation" mentioned

**HIDDEN (Never Show Directly):**
- Relief (he's dead)
- Terror (will they discover?)
- Love for James (desperate)
- Guilt about Emilia (real)

---

**ACT II (20h18-20h30) - Discovery:**
- **SCREAM:** Diaphragm, high-pitched, genuine shock

- "Who would... why would..."
- Let JC take charge
- 20h30: Distribute Tier 1 envelopes (somberly)

**ACT III (20h30-21h45) - Investigation:**
- Stay in character (grieving widow)

### Key Defense Lines (If Accused)

**Inheritance accusation:**
> "Married 4 years, every couple has insurance! How DARE you!"

**H+J handkerchief found:**
> "That's not mine. H could be anyone - Helen? Harriet?"

**Leading Reggie to office:**
> "YES! For his GIFT! Why would I hurt him?!" [tears]

**Final defense (if top 3):**
> "I lived with him 4 years. Every day. And you think I'd throw that away for money I didn't know about? Someone else killed him. Someone who HATED him. And God knows there were plenty."

4. Read aloud
5. React: "Cristina... não..." [genuine guilt]
6. Continue: "O jogo continua. Ela queria que resolvessem."

### The Twist Letter (~23h20)

Produce sealed envelope: "Open only if I die under suspicious circumstances"

**Key Points When Reading:**
- Grandmother Whitmore $80k inheritance
- Reggie HID it from Helena
- Could've divorced, been FREE
- Crime completely UNNECESSARY
- Money goes to Claire + Esmeralda (abandoned daughters)

**Your Reaction (devastated):**
> "I was an heiress? I could have divorced. Been free. We didn't need to kill him. Cristina died because I didn't know I was RICH. And now Claire and Esmeralda inherit. The daughters he abandoned. [bitter laugh] He wins. Even dead, he WINS."

## 💭 FINAL REMINDERS

**Helena's Core Truth:**
She believed she had NO CHOICE. The tragedy: she was wrong (inheritance existed). Greek tragedy level karma - nobody wins.

**Your Dual Role:**
Character (Helena) + Game Master. Balance both. If something goes wrong → improvise. Players won't know.

**Emilia's Death:**
This is HEAVY. Real emotions = okay. Check in with Cris before AND after.

**You've Got This.**
Trust your prep. Trust your instincts. This is YOUR game, and it's going to be AMAZING.
