- Shocked widow, trembling, dabbing eyes
- "I don't understand... who could..."
- Trust JC, defer to detective

### MICRO-TELLS (Subtle):
- Olhar James TOO long → catch yourself
- Flinch quando dizem "office"
- Avoid Emilia's eyes (guilt)
- Hand to throat quando "strangulation"

### HIDDEN (Never Show):
- "Tive que fazer. Não havia escolha."
- Relief + Terror + Guilt (Emilia)

## 🛡️ DEFENSE STRATEGIES

**Se acusam de inheritance:**
> "Married 4 years, every couple has insurance! How DARE you!"

**Se encontram H+J handkerchief:**
> "That's not mine. H could be anyone - Helen? Harriet?"

**Se pressionam sobre levar ao office:**
> "YES! I led him there! For his GIFT! Why would I hurt him?!" [tears]

**ÚLTIMA DEFESA (if top 3):**
> Stand, fierce:  
> "I lived with him 4 years. Every day. Smiled. Hosted. And you think I'd throw that away? For money I didn't know about?  
> Someone else killed him. Someone who HATED him. [look around] And God knows there were plenty."

---

## 💔 EMILIA SUICIDE (~22h30)

**When Cris (Emilia) exits quietly:**

Wait 3min, then:
> "Wait... onde está a Cristina?"

Send someone OR go yourself → find NOTE.

**Read note aloud** (Cris wrote it).

**React (REAL guilt here):**
> "Cristina... não... não não não..." [genuine tears]

**Then (GM mode):**
> "O jogo... continua. Ela queria que resolvessem."

---

## 🎬 ACT V - CONFESSION (~23h00)

**Stand, drop performance, stay in character but HONEST:**

> "Yes. We did it. Together. Planned, executed.  
>  
> Four years com ele. You saw elegant parties. You didn't see the rest.  
> You didn't see him control every dollar. Every friend. Every breath.  
> You didn't see how he made me feel OWNED.  
>  
> Then I met James. And I felt alive.  
>  
> So yes. We killed him. For love. For freedom.  
>  
> Was it worth it?" [look at Emilia's empty chair] "Ask me again."

---

## 📜 TWIST LETTER (~23h20)

**Produce envelope: "Open only if I die..."**

**Read aloud - KEY POINTS:**
- Grandmother Whitmore $80k inheritance
- Reggie HID it from Helena
- Could've divorced, been FREE
- Crime was UNNECESSARY
- Money goes to Claire + Esmeralda (rejected daughters)

**React (genuine devastation):**
> "I was... an heiress? I could have divorced. Been free.  
> We didn't need to kill him.  
> Cristina died because I didn't know I was RICH.  
> And now Claire and Esmeralda inherit. The daughters he abandoned.  
> [bitter laugh] He wins. Even dead, he WINS."

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCIES

**Players lost? Drop hint:**
> "Has anyone checked behind the piano?"

**Discover too early? Deny + add red herring.**

**Players give up? Extra Tier 2 clue:**
> "Oh! I almost forgot this..."

**Someone genuinely upset? PAUSE GAME:**
> Break character: "Let's take 5min. Everyone okay?"

**Running over time? Speed up Act V:**
- Shorter reconstruction
- Quick letter reading
- Fast debrief
