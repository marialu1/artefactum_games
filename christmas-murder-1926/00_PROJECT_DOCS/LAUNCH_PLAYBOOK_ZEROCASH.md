## PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

### Market Research (2024-2025 Data)

**Competitor Pricing:**
- **Night of Mystery:** $55-$80 (professional quality)
- **My Mystery Party:** $40-$55 (most popular tier)
- **Etsy sellers:** $15-$35 (variable quality)

**Your Game Quality Level:**
- 11 characters (most competitors: 6-8)
- 26 interconnected clues (most: 10-15)
- Professional Typst typesetting (most: Word docs)
- Historical accuracy (most: generic)
- **Positioning:** Premium tier ($55 regular price)

### Recommended Pricing Strategy

**Tiered Launch:**

```
Phase 1: Early Bird (First 50 buyers)
Price: $39
Marketing: "Join 27 hosts who've already pre-ordered"
Duration: 2-3 weeks

Phase 2: Regular Launch
Price: $55
Marketing: "Limited time: Save $14 with early bird (23 left)"
Duration: Ongoing

Phase 3: Seasonal Premium (Dec 15-24)
Price: $69
Marketing: "Last-minute Christmas party solution"
Duration: Holiday peak
```

**Psychology Tactics:**

1. **Anchor High:** Show "$69 regular" crossed out, "$39 early bird"
2. **Scarcity:** "Only 50 early bird copies at this price"
3. **Social Proof:** "Join 47 hosts who've downloaded this"
4. **Charm Pricing:** $39, $55, $69 (not round numbers)
5. **Value Stack:** List everything included (looks like $200+ value)

**Bundle Ideas (Future):**
- "Host's Deluxe Bundle": Game + Video + Canva Templates = $75
- "Mystery Collection": 3 games = $120 (when you make more)

### Price Testing Strategy

**Week 1:** Launch at $39 on Itch.io + Reddit
**Week 2:** Test $29 on Etsy + Pinterest (lower price, higher volume?)
**Week 3:** Raise to $55, see if conversions hold

**Track:** Revenue per channel, not just sales count.

**Benchmark:** 2-5% landing page conversion = good for digital products

## MARKETING CHANNELS

### 1. Reddit (Highest ROI for $0)

**Target Subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Size | Self-Promo Policy | Strategy |
|-----------|------|-------------------|----------|
| r/PartyGames | 50K+ | Lenient | Share character dossier photos as "inspiration" |
| r/tabletopgamedesign | 150K+ | Designer-focused | "How I designed 26 interconnected clues" (educational) |
| r/rpg | 2M+ | Must contribute first | Post game design process, not product |
| r/boardgames | 5M+ | Crowdfunding threads only | Wait for weekly showcase |
| r/murderminers (if exists) | ? | Check rules | Direct audience |

**Reddit 10% Rule:**
For every 1 self-promo post, make 9+ genuine contributions (comments, help).

**Viral Post Template:**

```markdown
Title: "I spent 6 months designing a historically accurate 1926 murder mystery. Here's my clue interconnection system."

Body:
[Image 1: Clue network diagram]

I wanted to create a murder mystery where every clue connects to 2-3 others, so players have to actually investigate (not just guess).

Here's how I designed 26 clues for 11 players:

1. Tier 1 (Initial): Each player gets 1 clue about another character
2. Tier 2 (Investigation): 14 clues hidden in "mansion" (living room)
3. Tier 3 (Decisive): 3 final clues that prove the murderer

[Image 2: Sample clue card]

The trick was making sure no single clue gives it away, but 5-6 clues together create the full picture.

Happy to answer questions about game design!
