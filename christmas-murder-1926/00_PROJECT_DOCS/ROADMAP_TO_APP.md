- ❌ NO → Improve prompts, delay launch

### Gate 5: After AI Month 1 (Dec 2026)
**Question:** Did we generate 50+ paid games?
- ✅ YES → Scale marketing, add features
- ❌ NO → Fix UX, improve quality, adjust pricing

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Manual Game Doesn't Sell
**Probability:** Low (you have quality product)
**Impact:** High (no validation for app)
**Mitigation:**
- Price test ($19-$29-$39-$55)
- Try different marketing channels
- Pivot to corporate team building (higher WTP)

### Risk 2: AI Quality Too Low
**Probability:** Medium (LLMs are good but not perfect)
**Impact:** High (refunds, bad reviews)
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive prompt engineering
- Human review layer (before delivery)
- Offer free regeneration (1-2 retries)

### Risk 3: AI Costs Too High
**Probability:** Low (models getting cheaper)
**Impact:** Medium (lower margins)
**Mitigation:**
- Use cheaper models (Groq, Llama)
- Cache common components
- Charge more ($69-$99/game)

### Risk 4: Competition Emerges
**Probability:** High (good idea = copycats)
**Impact:** Medium (market share dilution)
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (first-mover advantage)
- Build community/brand loyalty
- Add unique features (video, custom art style)

### Risk 5: Burnout
**Probability:** Medium (lots of work!)
**Impact:** High (project dies)
**Mitigation:**
- Set realistic timelines
- Celebrate small wins
- Take breaks between phases
- Hire help if revenue allows (VA, designer, developer)
