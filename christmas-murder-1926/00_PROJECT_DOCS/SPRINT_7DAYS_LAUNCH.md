📖 **Professional Quality:** Typeset with Typst (publishing-grade), not Word documents. Looks like a real 1920s artifact.

🎭 **Deep Characters:** Each character has 3-5 secrets, complex relationships, and genuine motivations. No cardboard cutouts.

**Daily routine (30-60 min/day):**
- [ ] Post 1 TikTok (reuse content, new captions)
- [ ] Engage on Reddit (reply to comments, find new discussions)
- [ ] Tweet daily (tips, behind-scenes, customer stories)
- [ ] Check email (buyer support + influencer replies)
- [ ] Monitor sales dashboard

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Post to 2-3 new subreddits
- [ ] Upload 3-5 new Pinterest pins
- [ ] Email 20 more influencers
- [ ] Review analytics, adjust strategy

**Goal Week 2:** 10-15 more sales (20-25 total)
**Goal Month 1:** 50 total sales = VALIDATED

## EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### "It's Day 3 and I have 0 sales"

**Don't panic. Try:**
1. **Lower price to $29** (test if price is the blocker)
2. **Get 5 friends to buy** (even at discount) → Use for social proof
3. **Post more on TikTok** (algorithm favors daily posting)
4. **DM people who liked your posts** (warm leads)
5. **Offer limited "beta tester" price** ($19 for next 10 buyers who give feedback)

### "Traffic is high but no sales"

**Conversion problem. Fix:**
1. **Shorten Itch.io description** (people aren't reading walls of text)
2. **Add video to landing page** (show, don't tell)
3. **Simplify pricing** (remove "pay what you want," set $39 fixed)
4. **Add more social proof** (even from playtest friends)
5. **Test different CTA** ("Download now" vs "Get instant access" vs "Start planning your party")

### "I got 2 sales but both requested refunds"

**Product problem. Urgently:**
1. **Ask why** (be genuinely curious, not defensive)
2. **Fix critical issues** (broken ZIP? missing files? confusing instructions?)
3. **Pause marketing** until fixed
4. **Offer to send revised version** to refunders (turn them into fans)

### "I'm overwhelmed"

**It's okay. Simplify:**
1. **Pick ONE channel** (whichever you enjoy most)
2. **Post there daily**
3. **Ignore everything else for now**
4. **Sales > perfection**
