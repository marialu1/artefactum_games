# Host an Unforgettable 1926 Murder Mystery Christmas Eve

**It's December 24th, 1926.** Manhattan's elite gather at Gatsby Rose Manor for a glittering Christmas Eve soirée. Champagne flows. Jazz plays. Secrets simmer beneath polite smiles.

**And then... someone is murdered.**

**Your guests become the suspects.** Each receives a character dossier with secrets, relationships, and hidden motives. One of them is the killer. One of them knows more than they're saying. And everyone has something to hide.

Can they solve the crime before midnight strikes?

## ✨ What Makes This Different

### 🎯 Historically Accurate
Not just "1920s aesthetic"—this is researched.

- Authentic 1920s Manhattan culture (Prohibition, speakeasies, social hierarchy)
- Period-accurate fashion (what each class actually wore)
- Real slang and language (no modern anachronisms)
- Historical timeline (1926 real-world events woven in)

**3 months of research went into authenticity.** If you love The Great Gatsby, Knives Out, or Agatha Christie, you'll feel right at home.

### 🧩 26 Interconnected Clues
Unlike generic mystery kits with isolated evidence, **every clue in this game connects to 2-3 others.**

Players can't just guess—they must:
- Cross-reference clues
- Compare testimonies
- Build a timeline
- Track relationships
- Actually investigate

The clue system was designed over 100+ hours to ensure logical flow without being too easy or impossibly hard.

### 📖 Professional Typesetting
This isn't a Word document export.

- Typeset with **Typst** (publishing-grade software)
- Custom 1920s-inspired layouts
- Vintage fonts (Crimson Text, Great Vibes, Lato)
- Art Deco design elements
- Looks like real 1920s artifacts

**Your guests will think you hired a professional designer.**

### 🎭 Deep, Cinematic Characters
No cardboard cutouts. Each of the 11 characters has:

- 3-5 secrets (public, semi-public, deeply hidden)
- Complex motivations (not just "greedy" or "jealous")
- Multiple relationships (love triangles, business rivalries, family drama)
- Moral grey areas (everyone has done something questionable)

**Inspired by:** Knives Out, Agatha Christie novels, HBO's Succession (1920s version)

### 🎬 Tested & Refined
This game was playtested with real friend groups over 6 months.

- Clues were rebalanced for difficulty
- Pacing was adjusted for engagement
- Red herrings were added (and removed when too confusing)
- Secrets were refined for maximum drama

**You're getting version 1.0 after extensive iteration.**

---

- ✅ **Corporate team building** (sophisticated, professional theme)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is this reusable?
**A:** This is a **single-use mystery**—once players know the solution, the surprise is spoiled. HOWEVER, you can:
- Host for different friend groups who haven't played
- Use the same materials multiple times with new audiences
- No limit on number of times you can print/play

### Q: How difficult is it to run as Game Master?
**A:** Designed for **first-time GMs!**
- Complete step-by-step instructions
- Timing guide (what to do when)
- Troubleshooting section
- No improv required (all dialogue/reveals scripted)

### Q: What if my group gets stuck?

- **Pacing adjustments** (speed up or slow down)
- **Emergency procedures** (if investigation stalls)

### Q: Can I customize character names?
**A:** Character names are **set** (historically researched, fit the era). You choose **which friend plays which character**, but can't rename them.

**Why?** Names are woven into clues, documents, and relationships. Changing them would break interconnections.

### Q: What if I have dietary restrictions/food allergies in my group?
**A:** The menu is a **design template** (not mandatory). You can:
- Serve any food you want
- Adapt recipes for dietary needs
- Order takeout and present it on vintage plates
- **The game is about the mystery, not the food!**

### Q: Is there graphic violence or mature content?
**A:** **Content rating: 16+**
- It's a murder mystery (death is implied, not graphically described)
- 1920s themes (Prohibition alcohol, speakeasies, affairs)
- Complex moral themes (betrayal, greed, secrets)
- **No graphic violence, sexual content, or extreme language**
- Think: Knives Out or Clue (the movie)—suspenseful, not traumatizing

### Q: Can I play this remotely (Zoom/Discord)?
**A:** **Yes, with adaptations!**
- Send PDFs to players digitally
- Use breakout rooms for private interrogations
- Share clue images via screen-share
- Works best with 6-8 players remotely (not full 11)

*Note: Designed for in-person, but remote is possible.*
