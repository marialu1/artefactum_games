- [ ] Collect feedback survey (what worked, what didn't)

### Commercial Launch (Mar-Jun 2026)

- Month 1: 50 sales ($1,950-$2,750) = product-market fit
- Month 3: 100 sales ($3,900-$5,500) = strong success → build app

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Canva Clues Lost
**Impact:** HIGH - 18/26 clues missing from filesystem
**Mitigation:** Export ALL clues this week, backup to cloud

### Risk 2: Dec 24 Game Fails
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Delays commercial launch
**Mitigation:** Test 1 act with 3 people before Dec 24

### Risk 3: No Commercial Interest
**Impact:** LOW - Game still fun for personal use
**Mitigation:** Price test ($29 vs $39 vs $55), adjust messaging

### Risk 4: AI App Too Complex
**Impact:** LOW - Don't build unless validated
**Mitigation:** Only proceed after 50+ manual sales

## NOTES

**User Decision - Digital Only:**
"nao vou ter pistas fisicas, é mais simples"
→ Smart choice. Reduces costs, shipping complexity, makes product scalable.

**User Strategy - Proof of Concept:**
"a ideia é ver se este vende, porque o objetivo a longo prazo é ver se vende para criar uma app que gera isso automaticamente"
→ Correct approach. Validate demand before building infrastructure.

**Zero Budget Constraint:**
"como é que os pro fazem, sem dinheiro haahah"
→ Itch.io (0% fees) + Reddit/TikTok organic + micro-influencer outreach = $0 launch possible.
