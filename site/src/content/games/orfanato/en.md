## The Case

**December 13th, 1985.** Three nuns are found dead in the Orfanato Nossa Senhora das Dores. All three died at exactly 3:33 AM. All three in different rooms. All three... impossible.

You are called to investigate. But as you dig deeper into the orphanage's 60-year history, you'll discover that the deaths are not a mystery to be solved—they're a reckoning to be understood.

## The Game

A hybrid experience combining:

- **Physical Box** — Documents, photographs, evidence
- **Digital Companion App** — Audio testimonies, interactive investigation
- **Cooperative Gameplay** — Work together or investigate alone

## What Makes It Different

This isn't a whodunit. You'll know who died. You'll know how.

The question is: **did they deserve it?**

## Content Warning

This game deals with:
- Institutional abuse (orphanage setting)
- Child harm (historical, not graphic)
- Religious trauma
- Supernatural horror

Recommended for mature players.
