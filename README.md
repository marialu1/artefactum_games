**Murder mystery games + AI-assisted development**

Learning AI by creating games I love. Each project is a learning journey documented from concept to playable product.

## Development Philosophy

1. **Learn by Doing** - Each game teaches new AI skills
2. **Document Everything** - The process is as valuable as the product
3. **Ship Something** - A finished game beats a perfect concept

### AI Skills Being Developed

- Prompt engineering for creative writing
- AI image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E)
- AI voice synthesis (ElevenLabs)
- AI video production (Runway)
- AI integration in apps
