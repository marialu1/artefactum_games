# Background Testimonies

These 5 testimonies are NOT included in the physical game.

They exist as:
- Character development reference
- Potential digital expansion content
- World-building material

| File | Character | Why Cut |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 01_FRANCISCA | Mother Superior | Her denial doesn't advance investigation |
| 03_MANUEL | Manuel (caretaker) | Overlaps with Rosa's information |
| 05_LUCAS | Lucas (orphan, 17) | Overlaps with Matilde's witness account |
| 08_PADRE_HENRIQUE | Father Henrique | Secondary, doesn't provide key clues |
| 11_TOMAS | Tomas (survivor) | Powerful story but not essential for solving |

## Potential Future Use

- "Director's Cut" expansion
