# Essential Testimonies

These 6 testimonies are included in the physical game box.

Each one serves a specific purpose in the investigation:

| File | Character | Purpose | Act |
|------|-----------|---------|-----|
| 02_DR_ANTONIO | Dr. Antonio | Describes impossible deaths, establishes mystery | 1 |
| 04_ROSA | Rosa (cook) | Reveals abuse history, heard children at 3:33 | 2 |
| 06_ANA | Ana (orphan, 15) | Sees Sofia's ghost, confirms supernatural | 2 |
| 07_MATILDE | Matilde (orphan, 12) | Witnessed death directly, key evidence | 2 |
| 09_IRMA_HELENA | Sister Helena | Gives cryptic MIGUEL clue, knows archives | 2 |
| 10_CARLA | Carla (survivor) | Confirms pattern, Sofia saved her | 3 |

## Selection Criteria

A testimony is ESSENTIAL if it:
1. Advances the investigation (provides clues)
2. Cannot be replaced by another testimony
3. Triggers emotional response in player
4. Fits within the 2-3 hour gameplay

## Usage Notes

- These may need editing to ensure puzzle clues are clear
- Check that 03:33 appears in relevant testimonies
