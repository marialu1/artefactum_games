## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS

### Critical (Must Decide Before Proceeding)
1. **Lock codes:** What are the actual codes and how are they discovered?
2. **Hint system:** How do stuck players get help?
3. **App tech:** What platform/technology?
4. **Testimony count:** All 13+ or trimmed selection?
5. **Video production:** How to create? AI? Filmed? Motion graphics?

### Important (Decide During Development)
6. Timeline template: Empty or pre-structured?
7. Difficulty calibration: How hard should puzzles be?
8. Playtime per phase: How to balance?
9. Physical props: Include or just documents?
10. Conclusion video: Confirm deduction or full reveal?

### Nice to Have (Decide Later)
11. AI integration possibilities
12. Expansion content
13. Multiple difficulty modes
14. Digital-only version option
