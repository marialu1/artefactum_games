## Concept

A supernatural murder mystery where three nuns are found dead simultaneously at 03:33 AM - each killed in a different way (throat slit, drowned, hanged). As investigators, players must piece together impossible evidence that leads to a terrifying truth: the nuns were child abusers, and their killers are the vengeful spirits of their victims.
